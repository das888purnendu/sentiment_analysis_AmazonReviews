0,3.0,"No doubt it has a great bass and to a great extent noise cancellation and decent sound clarity and mindblowing battery but the following dissapointed me though i tried a lot to adjust.
1.Bluetooth range not more than 10m
2. Pain in ear due the conical buds(can be removed)
3. Wires are a bit long which makes it odd in front.
4. No pouch provided.
5. Worst part is very low quality and distoring mic. Other person keeps complaining about my voice."
1,1.0,"This earphones are unreliable, i bought it before 15 days meanwhile right side ear buds got cracked automatically and it got divided in two parts, and sound quality is also not that much good but ok, one more thing bass is not good as it is a boat earphones.

Guys,
Also for the proof i have attached pics
Please see and think before buying​ this unreliable product.

Thanks."
2,4.0,"i bought itfor 999,I purchased it second time, gifted first one to brother. This is really good.
Sound quality is really good.
You can connect 2 devices at a time.I connect laptop and mobile both.when listening muaic on Lappy, if u get a call, it switches to mobile,this switch between device is not good but again in this price its awesome.
Battery stand by is 36 hours for me, and i have used it continously for 8 hours in one go. So Battery life is pretty awesome.
Comfortable on ear."

20,4.0,"The sound quality is good. I mean it can’t be compared with Senheiser or Bose but its worth the price.
Perfect to use while running; the earbuds are so comfortable that you wouldn’t even feel they are plugged in."
21,3.0,"Received this BoAt 255 earphones yesterday evening.
Sound quality is perfect. Good combination of Bass and treble. Can feel every beat.
Connectivity is quick. Detects and connects easily.
Battery life is good. Stayed around 10-11 hrs.As i received this yesterday evening. Have been playing since then. So its just the first day review. But performance is good.
Earphones looks solid. Build quality is good. The magnates are really helpful to hold the earphones. Earphones looks great.
Earphone wire could be bit long. But that's fine for me. Not sure about others.
Didn't get chance to charge so not sure about the time to full charge.
One thing i observed during my 10 hours play time that the music stopped playing itself in middle. Not sure it it gets disconnected or there is some technical problem.

But overall performance was nice. Good experience."
22,5.0,"I bought it for regular use, and satisified with the performance. However I have found some drawbacks, which needs to be mention.
1.Automatic power off:
after few minutes of non-usage its automatically getting disconnected, and powering off. It was good advantage on the other hand bcoz it was saving your power.

2.Noise cancellation :
It was literally good but little bit bad in calls, as person you are speaking with was hearing outside voice more louder than your voice.

Along with this it has so many advantages like better bass quality, simple design and good battery life and better battery saving options as i mentioned earlier. 😉

Go with boAt, if you have good budget than go with skullcandy which has same quality .
If budget is not a matter, go with Sennheiser CX 180 earphones, Mivi Thunder Beats Wireless Bluetooth Earphones

Hope this review helpful."
23,5.0,"Hey all, I have used quite a few budget earphones, Senn 180,213,soundmagic e18s, 1more piston, JBL t160, c150si, boat rockerz 225, compared the boat rockers 255 with all these earphones. Additionally I have a Philips basic, a Sony and a JBL headphone. I have bought these for my own use, a few friends and relatives. None of these can compare to the loudness bass and overall effect of these bt earphones. I'm obviously not an audiophile but I know the difference between a good sound and noise. The only concern I found was that the wires hang a lil low and the highs could have been sharper(nitpicking). Cant fault it otherwise. I have It paired with RN5 pro."
24,1.0,Product stopped working in a month time
25,1.0,"Right speaker is not working at all. Useless product.
Big disappointment."
26,4.0,This sound and bass quality is good battery life good noise cancelling is good but its wire is too long and uncomfortable which is not looking good wire is starting from top its looking bad but anyway everything is ok
27,1.0,"Below average product. Not happy at all.

Pros : good sound quality

Cons : very uncomfortable, silicon buds are not soft. Bought a memory foam bud pair to use it.
Battery life is just ok. Once give a low battery alarm, dies within 2 min
Little heavy on ears
No return possible"
28,3.0,"The product is a good buy if you are looking for a decent Bluetooth earphones with a reputed brand.

Sound quality 4/5)- pretty good with good amount of bass.
Durability (4/5)- the material seems durable and the earphones are light weight
Battery life (3.5/5)- It has a decent battery life of upto 5-6 hours playtime on 80% volume.
Connectivity (3.5/5)- gets connected with seconds but sometimes gets disconnected within a small range
Call quality (3/5)- call quality is decent, the person on the other end of the call can here you clearly however you need to place the mic exactly near your mouth. Sometimes the call gets distorted."
29,5.0,"Got it today, really loved the product.. awesome sound.. i was thinking to buy the Airpod but a friend suggested this to me.. Why spend so much!! So i ordered this and this really is amazing.. it looks good.. have great sound and doesnt hurt ua ears!! I am totally satisfied with this and couldnt say about battery as i have got it, today itself!"
30,4.0,"Overall good!
But I am unable to connect two devices simultaneously. Please Guide how can i do that.
Thank you!"
31,3.0,"he only problem is that as earpieces are of metal so they are heavier than a normal wired earpiece And that makes u feel uncomfortable as u start to feel heavier in ur ears and the earbuds are too sleepery, so heavy earpiece with sleepery earbuds will make u irritate. And seems like boat just focussed on bass for these earphones. Note my words just and just bass, too much bass for long time will surely give u headache. I bought these for 999/- but i don't think so they are worth that. My senhessier cx wired earphones are way too much better than these, way too much. So if u want to buy these then buy only for the sake of wireless feature and not for the sound and build quality."
32,5.0,Don't you guys check the product before selling ? just received the product and one side of the earphone is working and the other is not !
33,1.0,Rightside speaker stop working within 20 days.
34,5.0,"I am a prime customer of Amazon and I always purchase a product after so much research bought these boat rokerz in the sale in 1099 and trust me I am blown away by these I have used sony and other headphones in the price range of 5 & 6k but this is just similar to them in this price range ""sound quality"" 10/10 ""battery life"" seems good not tested for as described but will update soon ""durability"" 10/10 perfect fit no pain no discomfort.... Really boat has done a fantastic job with amazing music quality with superb bass in all highs mids &lows ..... Just go for it."
35,1.0,"Although sound quality is good, but then whats a purpose of buying a wireless earphone when its controls (buttons) doesn't work. I bought this product withing a week controls where stop responding cant switch on or do anything.
replaced it got refund bought another piece different color that worn out in a day.
Both the time seller was "" Appario Retail Private Ltd"". So i leave it to your wisdom whether you want to buy this or not. I will never buy this brand at least from this platform."
36,1.0,"Defective product. Not working, had to return the defective product."
37,5.0,"I just brought it in last week, and to be very frank,it's really Awesome. Beyond my expectations.
Sound quality is like having your own personal home theatre,too clear and loud enough, you can listen every single bit of music.And coming to battery backup, they said it's 6hrs but it's more than that, for me it's working near about one and more.

I will say,Go for it."
38,4.0,"◾Things We Like

✔️Battery life is good enough to provide 10 hours of continuous use.
✔️Designed with perfection to provide a smooth experience without any pain in ears.
✔️Sound quality is decent and it offers normal to tremble and bit lower bass.
✔️Comes at a very low price point which makes it perfect for that thing.

◾Things We Didn’t Like

❌Connectivity time is really high that it can frustrate you.
❌Durability is the concern as some people have negative reviews about it.

◾Verdict

✔️As you look at such a low price point, there is no doubt that boAt is rocking in the section of great earbuds. If you want to enhance the music listening experience then you can easily go for other versions but if you have a tight budget then this one is the perfect choice to go for."
39,1.0,Battery is faulty
40,2.0,"Boat blue tooth 255, ye doubt Voice quality is amazing for 30 days or so you will be big FAN or Boat but after 30days.. voice from of the side going down and even after 35 days you will not be able to hear anything from one side
Boat Service on same again so pathetic , raise an complaint almost 10days back for replacement or rapair but after 10days its reaches to their rapir center, not sure how many more days Boat will take to repair... Big Suggestion DO NOT BUY THIS"
41,1.0,"The item has been rendered defective three times in less than two months of usage. The first two times was due to charging issue and the third time due to sound distortion. Being under warranty, the item has been repaired the first two times and now I have registered a compliant for the third failure. The product has spent more time at the service centre than I have used it. Am completely dissatisfied with the reliability of the product."
42,5.0,"Awesome bass. This is even at low volume. So if bass is your thing these are the earphones for you. Really like the sound. There could be more clarity but nonetheless these are good.
Great battery life as well. Lasts about 5-6 hours.

The only grouse is that they are not very comfortable. I changed the plugs to the smallest but my ears still hurt. Maybe just takes getting used to.

Spent 999 for it on the great Indian sale. Definitely worth it."
43,1.0,"Let me tell you about the product in Details,
1. Sound Quality is good. It is harmless for ears. Not too loud but traffic noise can't disturb you while listening music.
2. Look is awesome but wires are too lengthy.
3. Battery Backup 'WAS' awesome. Six to seven hours after 1 or 1.30 hours charging
BUT
4. Product is not CHARGING AFTER ONLY TWO DAYS OF PURCHASE. And it is not acceptable. That's why the rating is ONE (lesser than one is not available though)
I will change my ratings and review too but after the replacement or refund against this product.
And one more thing, do not put too deep to this thing in your ears, it might be painful after few minutes.

Regards
SIDDHARTH"
44,1.0,"I had brought the piece after reading lot of reviews etc. when i purchased and started using it turned off and said battery low .. Thats fine as initial product charged battery full and started using it ..It started reconnecting most of time and sound started disappearing . I checking the range on the manual which said 10m and i saw when i placed my mobile in shirts pocket it was perfect and working and when i moved it to pants pocket it disconnected and reconnected . and it kept happening with 100% charge and was totally waste of time and value for this .
Tried many times and got to know its very small range one and doesnt come with proper range."
45,1.0,The headphones were good at the beginning but after a week getting disturbance on left side earpiece which stays for sometime
46,3.0,"The reason for this being an average product is that the pros are excellent but the cons also work against it.
Pros:
>Good noise cancellation
>Excellent sound quality
>Range is not bad
>Good battery life

Cons:
>The soft earbuds have a very small hole in it, so when you wear a helmet over it and if there is a slight change in the angle of the earpiece you are unable to hear anything from that earpiece unless you correct the angle.
>Durability: The left earpiece of my headphones stopped working within 2 months of use. The company repaired it and gave it back, but the time taken for the same was long. Also, the left earpiece projects lower sound than the right one.
>It does not inform when the Bluetooth gets disconnected after going out of range.
>Becomes useless after the battery reaches 20%. It keeps informing 'Oops! Battery low!' after every minute for the next 10 minutes and then switches off."
47,1.0,"No matter what is excellent in a product, it doesn't matter if it doesn't turn on after a day.

You guys are enforcing a replacement for a failed model.

We can't keep working with warranty and keep the product in manufacturer's shed for days.

Got shut down in two days. Boat needs to review this product.
Bottom 14% reviews say the same problem, issue with charging.

I have purchased 5 boat devices so far I am disappointed for the first time because of this product and ""enforcement"" for replacement.

This leaves me no option but to stop believing in BOAT's own customer service for the problems posted by customers. Amazon just play with its policies. Its the manufacturer who needs to go beyond and hel it's customers.

Refund me for this defective product and I would like to purchase a new one of different model or make."
48,4.0,"Audio quality is pretty good and the way it speaks bye amigos when turning it off is also unique.
It's durable and designed right.
It has mic opening towards down and engraved and rest of the headphone is completely covered,which makes it water resistant I guess.
Only things is that it looks weird when you leav it hanging around the neck unlike some other bluetooth headphones which have hard collar kind thing and then a wire stretching out of it. As it hangs too low from neck and the those hard collar kind ones look like small neck accessory when left hanging.
Either way I liked the product and it does the job. Battery back is also really good."
49,1.0,Very bad it's been only 3 months and it's one earphone is not working . One year warranty is useless no service centre service is there for help only waste of money .
50,1.0,Totally disappointed with the product and returned it. Boat rockerz 225 is better than this.
51,1.0,"Let me tell you that don't buy this. Yes it's true that it's the best product you can get for the price (I doubt that) but definitely it's not the best product YOU should buy.

Problems faced:
1. Battery is pathetic. Mostly gives 3 hours of playtime

2. The earphones get disconnected if you even go to the next room

3. Sound is too low. I have to use 3rd party Equalizer to listen clearly

4. The bass is also not good. Have to rely on the 3rd party apps

The only thing is Boat has a very good warranty service but the problems with the device make it a garbage af"
52,5.0,Close your eyes and just go for it. It is amazing at its price. I have got it at a festival sale which costs me 999 rupees. There is everything perfect in these bluetooth earphones. The bass is amazing even more than sony and jbl bt earphones. The sound is crystal clear. Mic quality is decent and battery life is about 6-7 hours of playback. Noise cancellation is pretty enough. I am very impressed from these earphones. And at last these earphones are stereo supported so you can enjoy 360 songs and also play pubg with these bluetooth earphones. Really i love boat.
53,3.0,"I am pleased to write a review and i will talk both about pros and cons:

Pros:

1. Good Bass
2. Sturdy
3. Great look
4. Good noise cancellation

Cons:

1. Forget buying this if you are planning to use it for gaming like battle royale games, There is an issue with the latency or bluetooth lag, You will hear the noise 3 seconds after you fire the gun.

2. Disspointed battery backup, max is 1 or 1.5. hours if you continously use it at low volume.

3. Wrong place where the charging port is installed, difficult to plugin or plug out.

UPDATE: AS OF TODAY, JAN 15TH 2020 - One of the sides stopped working within 6 months. However, I claimed the warranty and got a replacement in 15 days. No hassle apart from the duration to get a replacement."
54,5.0,"Its grear earphones. I was sceptical when i bought it for 1499, as price was so less for wireless ear phones. Bass is on point and battery life is approx 8-9 hours. You hardly feel it in your ears. Mic picks up all the noise so thats one minus but you can still hear the the sound. Mic is very sensitive so you can speak almost for yourself and still other person will get you."
55,1.0,"Got the delivery today(12/12/2018)
Initial Impressions:The Audio was really good..nice bass..comfortable fit.Audio 4/5
But after few hours of usage the right earphone stopped working..Audio output through right earphone is not as loud as left earphone."
56,1.0,Worst product
57,4.0,"I got this product by 03/12/18 by 04:45 PM. Immediately opened the package to see how the condition was, however it came in a well packed box and on top of it Amazon's insulated cover with invoice. Opened the headphone and put charging through laptop for a few minutes and started using it.

Pros:
1. Connecting to my new OnePlust 6T within no time and giving a sound with a bold voice stating ""You are now connected to Boat Rocerz 255""
2. Base is really awesome, able to hear vocals properly, well mounted ear tips helps you to use the headphone for longer time
3. Call quality is fine and more over noise cancellation is ok
4. Music is so good to listen while driving.

Cons:
1. Multi-functional is not so compatible to my phone (it's my assumption), where I could not able to got to the next song or previous song.
2. Noise Cancellation is not that much awesome but yeah can able to listen our voice properly by the other side.
3. If we give pause for 5 minutes to the song while listening through this, you should go back again to your phone to replay it again

Overall it's a satisfactory deal and worth every rupee we spend on it. As this is my second product from Boat I strongly recommend this."
58,1.0,"Just purchase it with your eyes closed man. In 1500 bucks no-one will ever give you such a Bass and good audio quality WIRELESS BLUETOOTH Earphone. Just don't think so much.

I don't know about the lasting of the product but feeling the build it seems very premium. This is my first day usage review.

===≠====≠===
Writing after 5 months of using
One of earbud stopped working without any reason today.
Pathetic product I must say now"
59,3.0,"Got this for Rs. 999. A great deal for the price.
Bought it socially for multipoint features.

Works great with 2 mobiles but I have found that it keeps running into connecting issues with a Windows 10 laptop. It may take a while to connect back with a Windows 10 laptop.

Battery is okay. Can't take it off the whole day.
Don't expect noise cancellation. Sound is great. You can enjoy bass. Another little annoying thing apart from connecting with Windows Laptop is the crackling sound which I can hear sometime for no reason even in close proximity of the streaming device."
60,4.0,"So this is my take on the boAt Rockerz 255 Sports Bluetooth after one month of usage and hope this satisfies most of the queries here.

Pros:
------

1. Pretty Quick Connectivity. It hardly took me less than a minute to get started with it.

2. The sound quality is quite good. While driving on high altitude windy areas, the sound clarity is still clear and that makes me give it a thumbs up.

3. The battery life lasts for almost 3 days and thats quite reasonable for me

Cons:
-------

1. Though there aren't many cons but yes the noise cancellation is quite less when compared to many other earphones

2. Quality checks need to be taken care of since we had to get one of our earphones exchanged due to connectivity issue

Overall it is a great value for money for earphones. Do pick it up,"
61,2.0,"Hello I bought this product in big sale going on , got it for 1099 which is good deal.
Later on it was for 2.5k don't buy at this price waste of money.

Sound n bass is awesome
Battery not sure yet

Songs can't be changed using music keys and music key functions are uncertain

Music starts playing from phone suddenly after the call

Double tapping of play/stop button dials last caller, which is greatest con of this product"
62,1.0,Product not working within 1 month from purchase
63,3.0,"Hi, i bought this for 1500 from amazon but to tell you did not found out this worth 1500. Bought this after seeing 4 star rating from amazon users but seriously not worth 4 stars.

1. Bass may be there but the sound is not powerfull and sharp. I tried to switch between plug in ear phone and boat wireless and found that the sound is not great although bass may be there.
2. As some user has mentioned the mic is not good which i also feel
3. If you arr looking for style then it doesn't look stylish. The earphone wires should come from behind not front as it looks odd.
4. Noise cancellation is good.
5. Ear comfort is ok.

If i have to buy again i would rather by wireless earphone at 600 bucks from metro station amd may feel disappointed rather than spending 1500 buck and feeling disappointed.

This product should be in the range of 600 to 800 max

Still if you need something desperately wireless and at some affordable cost then its ok.

Have heard from some colleagues that you may find some good wireless earphone from Ali express"
64,2.0,"I have been using the headset for 2 months. The battery life is pathetic. It might huff and puff to 4-5 hrs before the annoying ""your battery is low"" notification starts piercing your ears. The noise cancellation is avergae and the Mic is the biggest let down. When I use this for calls when I am in my room, my sound gets diffused in the sound my ceiling fan makes and the other party will be having lots of difficulty hearing us. And the ear pains a lot after half an hour of usage due to the ear-holder kind of thing provided on the buds. I won't recommend this to anyone. I read and watched a lot of reviews before buying this. Most reviews were rating it pretty high. So I have learned one thing, do not go solely on these reviews when buying things from these kinds of manufacturers, those might be paid ones..!
Happy Shopping!!"
65,2.0,"Purchased it for 999. And the price does justifies its quality but for music purposes it does lags. Bass is still justified for its price. Basic functions dont work as desired like overriding the use of buttons. The startup and shutting down voice is very annoying. Could have kept very subtle.
And also battery drains out quickly. The microphone is the worst. The person at the other end wont be able to hear you clearly. The built quality is very cheap. Dont expect it to be durable for long just keep it safe.
Also when I used it during running the audio started to interrupt regularly which was very very annoying. I had to abstain from using it during morning jog. After this experience am giving it only 2 stars."
66,1.0,"It is too bad..this ear phones could not completed even a month it has been only 20 days..and it's battery getting heated battery running time getting shorter by the time today it play only 1 hour ,next thing is it has been 5 days since it's one side earhone is not working..feeling cheated.."
67,4.0,Sound quality is good. noise cancellation is not upto the mark. battery quality is decent. by charging it once you can enjoy upto 5hrs of music without any issue
68,1.0,"For the first month it was good. But from the starting i was having blue tooth connectivity issue. It was not even having good connection within 5metres. Then within 30 days due to sweating it completely stopped working. I am still searching for the right wireless ear phone which can be used for long run, marathon and resist sweating.

Very poor customer care service. I returned the product and have to wait for 3 week for dispatching a new one. Still on 4th week no shipment done."
69,1.0,Sound quality is worst
70,1.0,"Its not sweat proof that is clear it will malfunction when you run on treadmill wearing it
Sound is good
Battery is good
but its not full sweatproof
Also will stop working after one month"
71,1.0,The unit stopped charging within months of purchase. Was replaced by boat in 10 days of complaint with a refurbished unit. The replacement provided was faulty with distortion of sound in one side and a 5 hour charge lasted for only 30 mins. Had to raise another complaint. Seems they don't do proper quality check before giving replacement. Will update on this basis the experience of the second complaint raised.
72,4.0,"I got it for INR999 and that's the reason am giving it a 4star rating. For casual listeners , it has decent sound . I found it very clear not comparable to Hi-res earphones (ofcourse). It has good amount of bass but not deep bass instead more of a muddy bass but what else can you expect at this price. But it is good for casual music but i found it little weird for watching movies. Connectivity is ok . Not great cause if you'll put your phone behind your body like in case u keep ur phone in your back pockets , the connection gets lost. Moreover , since it's a Bluetooth 4.1 even the range is around 10m or less. Build quality seems good but only time can tell that. I have another boat product called Boat Rockerz 600 ( it was their flagship product then) , which is a very good product. I have it for more than an year now and it's still running very strong though i don't use it as my daily driver. Only problem is that it's earpads are in really bad shape so i have similar hopes with this product too. And if you are confused between this or other similarly priced earphones like Boult, tagg and all don't bother they all are Chinese earphones re-branded and marketed as Boat or tagg etc. So i believe they should sound very similar. And the MRP written on them is basically a maketing gimmick. There's no way these kinda earphones could cost more than INR1500.

And now for "" Audiophiles"" ,well if you are one , you won't be looking at these anyway. So that's it . Happy shopping."
73,5.0,"Product design is good and very durable. The best feature is the sound quality and its design. However what i didn't liked is the battery backup. Its up hardly for 3 to 4 hrs if continuously powered on which requires to be charged atleast 2x a day. Overall I would say , its a good deal only if its under 1K or max 1.2K inr.. otherwise I wont recommend it."
74,1.0,"I have purchased the product on 7 Dec 2018 stopped working In Feb 2019, Reported it to boat, as per amazon, after a trial of email, the executive does not answer the call who was supposed to pick the product and drops a text that ""NO I AM NOT COMING"". I am left with faulty headphones now. What am I supposed to do with it."
75,1.0,Just one month nd gone. Product sucks. Please don't buy. Not finding at service centres as well.
76,1.0,"At first it's look good. While using sometimes it fell out of the ears. I have changed all the earbuds to suit my ears but it fell of when you are looking down.
Now it's stopped left side. No tanglin nothing don't know how it stopped. Don't waste the money by buying cheap Bluetooth.
I had a faith in boat because of their sound quality which they had in small budget earphones but this one is not worthy
Bass is medium not punchy for that bass you can choose boat basshead ₹599 its very good."
77,3.0,"I have earlier used two Boat earphones, and this was my third purchase.
Packaging - great. It came in a box which includes extra eartips, manual, USB charger, earphones and a case.
Sound quality - good at the price range. The bass is strong, good for edm.
Bluetooth connectivity - good, both range wise and quick pairing. It has two device pairing. I earlier had connectivity issues between Lenovo devices and boat, none this time.
Noise cancellation - decent.
Fit - the earbuds aren't the most comfortable but shouldn't be any pain with moderate use. Also, it is unlikely to fall off with fast walk or jogging. However, the neckabamd seems flimsy.
What I didn't like - I have never been a fan of neckband style earphones. And these looked ill fitted. The neckband and the wires are bigger than required.
I didn't use it for the ill fitting so would have to cut the review short."
78,1.0,Product STOPPED working in just 20 days useless even the 10 day return policy is over now no refund & waste of my hard earned money
79,1.0,Would have used hardly for 5 to 8 hours since I got this product and it does not charge now. Return window already crossed and a total loss for me. Amazon stop selling such substandard products plz.
80,1.0,"I bought this product after a long wait for drop in price for 1500 finally but just after few days of buying it for 1500, the price further dropped to 999! Really unhappy about having to spend 500 extra! Quality wise they're good but not exceptional. Also the eartips hooks are smaller than other branded earphones so not interchangeable with other earphones! I find it very inconvenient because my Sennheiser earphones have much better quality tips which I cannot fit on these as they fit lose."
81,2.0,"I don't usually write reviews for products but I must do for this one to let people know about the issues I am facing. I will try to cover all aspects of these earphones in this review.

*Reliability:*
The earphones get disconnected after some time if you don't use it for like 3-4 hours. It's very frustrating since you have to start the earphones first before picking up the call. Also, when you pick up the call you don't know whether to use phone or earphones to speak since you don't know whether they are connected. Though a small issue, it's really frustrating, trust me.

*Experience:*
The earphones are pretty useful and give all kinds of signals (if you have plugged it in your ear) like connected, disconnected, battery low. But what is most frustrating is the battery low signal which is not just a beep, but a long sentence it says ""Oops, battery low"". This keeps on repeating every 30 seconds which really annoys me. If the battery is low, it should just beep if they have to. But every time bugging is not a good experience.
Also, it takes a bit too long to power on and power off. You have to press the button for like 5-7 seconds.

*Sound Quality:*
The first song I listened to these earphones sounded really terrible with high bass. But it's not really bad if you are not into too much sound details.

*Build Quality:*
Build quality is really good. No issues with that.

*Battery life*
Satisfied with battery life. But it doesn't last that long as promised. But I am okay with that."
82,5.0,Awesome best budget wireless earphones
83,4.0,Need to claim warranty one side speaker is not working
84,1.0,I buyed the product and it stopped working after 2 months.The after sale service of boat is very bad and pathetic .
85,3.0,"It was priced around 2.7K initially. But I definitely know it doesn't worth it. I got it in an offer for Rs.1.1K. Still it is not worth the price. I was just looking for some stuff, without having to plug in the 3.5mm jack to my mobile - and it serves that purpose. Other than that, it is not for music lovers who wants to listen to music for long hours. in 30 minutes it starts hurting and I started to develop ear/headache if I continue to listen more than 1 hr. Definitely not suitable for laptops - it keeps disconnecting frequently for no reason. Recently it starts doing the same with my mobiles as well. Battery is not great with daily 1 hours of hearing battery lasts max 3 days. The string is annoyingly long, it dangles upto your stomach. I have seen earphones with reasonable length, this one is awkwardly designed. You cannot wear them without getting attention from onlookers.

If you are ready to spend another 1000 bucks go for good brands like JBL, Senheiser etc. If you want to cut cost, well this is the Best among the other worsts in the market"
86,2.0,"The wire from the band to the ears is too long. Previously, I was using Skull Candy (which i lost so went in for a cheaper option). Skull Candy wire length was perfect. In Boats Rockerz, because the wire is too long, it keeps bumping against my neck when i run. The sound of the wire hitting the neck echoes in the ear pieces. Also, when i do floor exercises, the longish wire hangs uncomfortably around the neck. Sound quality and battery life is decent for the price, though. So if you plan to buy it for casual listening, go ahead. Wouldn't recommend for serious workouts."
87,4.0,"I like the sound quality, it's quite good. But it doesn't really stick in your head quite well. Think about that before ordering"
88,5.0,Better in price range of 1399 best for use microphone quality is like wired headphone not only good for hearing music but also for talking with ur love ones at night.. best in all ur budget is under 1500 if ur budget is 4000 then go true wireless but in that u will miss the microphone quality u have to speak louder good for daily use bass is not best but okay type in this price range of wireless headphone neon and black colour is good all the three colours look awesome noise cancellation is not that much it fit properly u can use for gym heavy workout but due to neckband its little heavier and feeling of wired around neck as this is Bluetooth headset then not that much long lasting coz u have to charge the battery and one day after one year may the battery get damaged don't charge is frequently once its less than 20% than only charge this headphone battery backup of continues use in starting is 4 to 5hrs and at standby mode u can use it for 2days.. once u get this u will forget ur phone as whenever call will come u Don't have to run just use ur connected headset to receive the call . U can also pair smart watch and this headset together
89,1.0,"I had bought the earphones about 20 days back. They were working absolutely fine. They fit perfectly and sound great.
But after 20 days of working they stopped working. They wont switch on. I tried charging with powerbanks, PC, chargers (I was very careful of not exceeding the amperage for charging and I didnt exceed the limit). Now to claim warranty I have to send this to the company which will take at least 10-15 days. This is very unfortunate and I am seriously questioning the legitimacy of this brand."
90,4.0,"Very Good Neckband, Price Wise This Is The Best Neckband Available On Amazon.
But, Only One Problem There Is No ""Voice Assistant"" Available.
Otherwise Everything Is OK....."
91,1.0,"Dont go for this product. I have seen the reviews and purchased it but to my surprise, the ear phones are very bad at producing the decent bass,instead the bass is too heavy that even a bass head like me does not find it good. Too heavy to use it for longer times, u might end up hurting ur ears."
92,5.0,"** the product was a perfect purchase... but it is not charging, requested for replacement..
Replacement is quick and so prominent... Thank You boAt team...
Pros:
•Soft feeling wearing this ""boAT Rockerze"" and look also good..
•The sound quality is excellent, it's like a premium brands...
•I am using just after receiving the product without charging and it is going on and on. The battery lasts for full 2days. Am so happy.
•Value for money.
Cons:-
Not find still now..."
93,4.0,"Day 2 (Aug 12th 2019)
I watched videos and listen to few songs. It did not hurt in ear. My purpose of buying them was for calls only. I do find them good. I checked with few people through Skype as well. It was good. It did last for more than 6 hours. When I received it was 100% charged. I started using it. Today the only challenge I saw was it was not connecting with my Bluetooth when it was left with 20% battery. I put it on charge. It recharged within the time of 1 hour or so.

Date : August 17, 2019 - I am not music freak but the quality and sound is good for music. I majorly use it for my long day calls through Skype. In starting it was good, there were no issues. After few days I started facing connectivity issues. On 15th I was watching something or other whole day. I noticed that till the time I was using it the battery % was 100. I took a break and reconnected it was like 80%. This was the percentage after a regular play time of approx 3 hrs. Suddenly it started giving audio message ,oops and all that . The battery was showing 20% and it turned off at 20% battery. This was little upsetting for me. I requested for a replacement so I will be getting it on Aug 20, 2019.

In this 1 year I have used 5 Bluetooth earphones. iBall, U8i, Samsung Muffspro and boAT. To give them a rank it will like this (Best at 5)
1. Samsung
2. iBall
3. Muffspro
4. U8i
And the winner among them is boAT.

This review is completely after using these mentioned headphones for more than 4 hour each day. The review is based on Battery,Sound Quality, Ease of talking on phone, Ear comfort. All these products were under 3000 INR.
The best part about boAT is quality, durability and battery. I might be buying an upgrade device of it soon."
94,5.0,"Bought this product in mid january 2019 Second bought in may 2019. After almost 8 mnth of usage( first one), happy to give my reviews for this product.
Got the product at 999/- in lighting sale on amazon on sankrant offer. delivery withing 2 days . product arrived in a very good impressive box with proper hard casing to product from damage. Amazon shipped the product in proper safe packaging. Over all product plastic built quality is strong,feel of the headset is smooth . Comes in 3 colours namely red/black , green/black and full black.
Coming to pros and con of the product

Pros
1. light weight , wont feel and pain around neck for prolonged usage
2. large battery for almost 2 days usage
3. clear crisper ear phones sound, adequate bass and treble, for more effect use mobile equaliser.
4. 3 types of ear buds provided for different ear size.
5. fits well in ears with in ear loop to keep them in position while jogging, the loops don let the ear buds to fall.
6. loud sound with volume up/down buttons, multifunction power buttons act as power on/off, single click for calls receive / hangup option double click to call last dialed number, , long press volume up / down to change songs, single click volume buttons to change volume.
7. Coming to connectivety, trust me it connects to mobile bluetooth within 15 seconds. easy first time pairing,
Keep the power button pressed for 5 or more secs, the indicator light blinks red and blue meand its in pairing mode , start searching the bluetooth in mobile select one u see the name boat rockers and voila ur now connected.
the voice commond will speak that its connected.
8. voice prompt in the bluetooth headset have 5 commands , power on, power off, ur now connected and battery low and incoming call alert.
9. yes its say noice cancellation and its works flawless. clear sound to opp party in event of loud background noises during calls.
10. range of bluetooth is good i tested for 20 feet in house.
11. charging cable is provided, no charger.
12. Also service center is really good but just little slow.
headset got malfunctioning in 6th month , raised an online complain on the website mentioned, got complain no. withing few min of form filling , next day bluedart courier person came to pick the headset, withing 10 days after the complain new headset is deliverred via bluedart .

Now few cons

1. wires for the headset is quite long so its is hard to handle during transit in crowded public transport,
2. the ear bugs tend to fall off during corwded public travelling so be careful.
3. during summer wearing it will create little discomfort due to sweat so just be careful, sweat can slide and damage the product.

Thats it overall a really trust worthy brand with a strong durable build quality and longer lifeline.
Buy it without second thought.

This is my 3rd purchase and all 3 still working till today (review edit date.11/01/2020)"
95,2.0,"Product received on time there is no issue. Sharing my experience here for you to decide before you go for this product only.

During calls suddenly it goes blank.

There is no noise cancellation or its not working properly. Always people on call ask me ""are you outside, we are getting so many noise""

I have ordered replacement, after 15 days i received serviced item (may be before that someone used and returned to boat), Same issue persist but now I don't know what to do... and I am not using this for important office calls. Just using for hearing music & watching movies. Replacement process is good, they only come and collect your product and return using courier, if you raise ticket online. Problem rectified or not that's matter.

Overall my suggestion / experience I could say ""Don't go for this product if you really want to use it for official purpose"""
96,1.0,"While the quality is good, sometimes party on the other end of the call are not able to hear us. Also the external noise while is motion is high than our voice. Good for hearing songs but not for handling calls...
After 6 months of usage....one side wire got tampered and no connectivity to one side now.....very disappointed."
97,4.0,"Pros:
charge time 2 hrs and backup is very good full day use (6 hr continuous)
two led colors red and blue . while using blue light blinks after every few secs,
in-build ringtone (trrrin trrrin type).
using in honor 6x show battery icon in 100-80-50-25-0 stages.Gives warning on low battery and when connected or disconnected (human voice).
Lightwight,good build quality.
i replaced rubber earplugs with piston earphone plugs, the 3 pairs comes with package are not too soft but are fine.
you can control volume of pc and mobile depends on which device is currently playing.
i am using piston onemore ,music quality is not to that level but is pretty decent. bass is balanced
cons:
Range is 10m in real world plays well if u are in room , the moment you walk out of room then distortion occurs.
mic is very sensitive and works fine so far no complains from other end. i have not used outside the room.
when it keep it for charging it gets switch off on it own then have to reconnect it again (not a big issue) .
...
first i had doubt on it battery,sound quality,mic quality but after using it i am happy even though i have used one more ,boat 255,mi earphone 399 , Samsung earphone, Phillips 249 etc."
98,2.0,"Bought this 4 months back.

Pros- good sound, nice battery back, very light on neck. Good only for listening to music

Cons - really bad for using it for its actual purpose. It has got no noise cancellation hence people will nt be able to hear you clearly.

My advice avoid buying it as you can't return it"
99,4.0,"I bought these earphones on 23 March. My experience with these headphones is quite great. I got delivery on time, packing was great and sealed. So talking about functioning- it comes with the sound quality you will love. Bass is good enough to make your toes move. Mic is of good quality, Noise cancellation could have been even better but I think thats great for this price range. Works with dual phone and for for about 7-8m radius. Battery backup is good. Though it has 10 min charge system, full battery charging takes time. Buttons are working well. Build quality is superb. In short you can go for it if you are thinking to buy it."
100,4.0,Nice product. I love it's sound and bass. I purchased for me and another two for my family members after I make sure for it's sound quality. But one thing I really concerned here about it build quality. Mine replaced for two times till now for it's power button issue. It will take 20 days to replace the product. First time after 20 days of purchaseing and then after three months. Now they clame this new replacement is a good one. Let's see how many days it will again goes.
101,4.0,"I purchased this product for 999/- and received it one day (Thanks to Amazon). I am going to split the review about this product into PROS and CONS.

PROS:
1). Sound quality - As i am a bass lover, I have satisfied with the sound stage of this device. Lows and mids are clear with an adequate amount of bass.
2). Build quality - Build quality of the product is exceptionally great for this price and it has two magnets which holds the ear pieces in place.
3). Sweat proof - Suitable for gym freaks. It can easily withstand the splashes and sweat since it has IP rating.
4). Battery life - This product can last for 6 to 8 hours depending on your usage. Charging time takes around 45 minutes to reach 100%

CONS:
1). Connectivity - Bluetooth range is not that great. After moving 5 meters away from the device, the connectivity gets lost. So, mostly make sure that you carry your mobile along with you and the battery information about the device is not appropriate. Some times it shows 80% in my device and all of a sudden it indicates 20% battery remaining.
2). Tactility - Buttons on this headphones are not that easy to press. It needs some hard presses which sometimes feel irritated.

So, if you are a good bass lover and looking for a good wireless earphones at an affordable price then this should be your choice probably."
102,2.0,"Reviewing after 5 months of use.

Pros:
1-Sound quality is awesome.
2- You don't need to take your phone everywhere.
3- You look AMEER.

Cons.
I will tell you sone cons that no one ever told you.

1- That curved supporter which stuck in Pinna (part of ear) to provide more balance, start hurting in just 30 mnts. You have to use earphone without that.
2- Every size of earbuds hurt your ear from inside.
3- One side of earphone stopped working in 4 months and replacement process takes about 25-30 days.
4- This is not only me who suffered this problem, all my friend who bought this product have replaced it atleast once in 5 months.
5- USB cable which is provided with this product stopped working in 2 months.
6- Ameer dikhoge to dost Party mangenge."

# Battery lasts 6-7 hours, could have been little longer, but its fine

# Excellent noise cancellation
# Sound quality is something I didn't expect of this level - Good, very good. Good punch, high frequencies are delivered well, deep and rich bass. Loved it!!
# Bluetooth works flawlessly"
104,2.0,"I made my choice based on the boat headphones with cable I have purchased in the past. But as compared to them, the noise reduction is really poor. in fact, it picks up more noise from the background. the person at another end can hear the bump sound of the car in a pothole while driving.
These are not good if you are planning to use for official calls.
Bass is TOO high. Bass as high sound good for metal or Jazz music, but in these headphones, it suppresses the other instruments.
Fit in the ear is good and battery life is also as mentioned."
105,1.0,"after using it for 4 weeks it has stopped working very disappointed. After service of this product is also horrible i will defiantly not recommend this product horrible horrible experience all the money gone into waste:(
never recommending your company to any one you guys are worst for sure"

Very uncomfortable,
Sound also not good

107,5.0,"Really like the base and sound quality for this price. It's good to listen to music. I have a Bose 300 QC but I'm using this on a day to day basis as carrying QC wherever I go is not practical. I going this headphone is quite enough for my music need . The microphone is working as expected.
The only issue is that the headphone doesnt announce the battery percentage. However my OnePlus 6t shows headphone battery when connected. The headphone give the annoying message ""battery is low"" from 20% onwards."
108,1.0,After 3 months right one of headphone is stop working if yu loved to run then it is not for you it will fall easily when yu go for a walk very bad Quality Wasted my 1499rs customer is not receiving my calls they said we will help you bt they didnt
109,1.0,Still struggling to get through the customer care of Boat! Which is virtually non existent. Whenever I get to talk to their customer support all they do is promise that they are working on it and never get back. I would recommend to go for products which has a decent after sales service. Boat is proving to be the typical use and throw China product!

✔ COMPARISON
•••••••••••••••••••••••

I already have Nokia BH 505, Sennheiser HD 4.40, & Byte Corseca DM5710 in the wireless category and Sennheiser CX 180, JBL C150si & MI basic earphones. To be honest, wrt sound quality, this Boat one is far behind all of them except MI basic & Byte Corseca where it's equivalent.

The reason being, you can't get everything at such a low price point. If you want good quality in-ear wireless experience to be ready to shell out more.

Every product category has a minimum price value required for impressive performance. Below that value, compromises need to be made.

P.S. Battery backup is not an issue owing to the form factor. It's comparable to BH 505 and ranges around 5-6 hours. It even cant be compared to over the ear HD 4.40 as it has a hefty battery inside.

📅 CHECK THOROUGHLY WITHIN 10 DAYS WINDOW
••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••

Initially had connectivity & mic issues, so ordered a replacement that resolved those issues.

In the returned product, the mic was not working properly and had sound quality issues while in case of connectivity, it had frequent disconnection issues.

So make it a habit to thoroughly check the product within its replacement window of 10 days, and in case of any issue contact Amazon asap instead of complaining later on and providing a low rating.

▶ Nothing is perfect and that's why they have a return/replacement window to provide the best possible service for online shopping.

🏆 VERDICT
••••••••••••••••

▶ For the price point, this earphone is a good buy with nice sound output, heavy bass, and good backup. I have been using it for 4-5 months and so far didn't face any issue.

▶ If you can increase your budget go for JBL -> Sony -> Senheisser (increasing order of price and sound quality)

▶ BUT if you are not obsessed with wireless functionality or you can avoid this wireless part, better invest that amount in wired in-ear earphones (over the ear will require further investment) as for the same amount you will get astounding sound quality."
111,1.0,"Good for a few weeks. After that the battery heated up drastically, and melted the rubber buttons. I luckily stopped charging in time, else may have even caught fire. Now the buttons are fused and the product can't be used.
Hope Amazon will promptly replace the defective product."
112,4.0,"Well i used boat products before they are good as they were before.
pros - base is good , water resistant ( here doscription says IPx4 but my earphone box says IPx5, and that is even better , you should update your product description. ) , Magnet lock , design .

Con - cable is a bit long. As it has control box both side and a little hard cable at back, the remaining cable shouldn't be this long.

Above all its a good product. Recommend to all the people who wants to buy a cheap but best wireless earphone."
113,3.0,"When connected to my cellphone (galaxy s9) it would show battery 80%. Exactly 80%, not less or more than 80. It would show battery to be 80% even if the battery is down and suddenly after using for 1 hour it would come down 20% and at that point it would say that battery is low. But it would keep saying low battery until it's shut down. Even if you can listen to a 3 min. song in low battery, it would keep saying low battery in between the song .
Got it for 1100 rs. so cannot complain a lot.
Thanks !"
114,3.0,"I have bought this earphone once , replaced once and finally about to get refund after i returned it second time. Thanks Amazon and seller for initiating the refund. I am not a sound specialist but i am a good listener. My first lengthy review is below.
Pros:
1. BASS, really heavy bass.
2. while listening to music, Double press invokes the last phone call . On the GO call. So when riding in bike it is useful to call my wife ;-)
3. can use it when wearing a helmet.
4. really good wires and sturdy. So life of the earphone is assured.
5. Neck design if u like it.
6. Easy to connect. Range/Connectivity is good even when there are many obstacles in between.

Cons:
1. Mic is at the end of the neck design i.e not closer to mouth. So the other person on the call can't hear properly. Mic picks up so many noise as no MEMS in this.
2. Bass is not everything in music. Too much of bass. Even equalizer adjustments to reduce the bass does not help.
3. Battery life is mediocre when compared to others.

I have bought Mi basic bluetooth headset after returning this.
Pros: Dynamic enjoyable bass even at higher volume, MIC noiseless,
Cons: wire quality is poor. have to keep it carefully.

CHEERS!!!"
115,5.0,"Super Bass is like ""Baby Ko Base Pasand Hai"". Good sound quality. Noice cancellation is Okay. Fits perfectly with in-ear buds and ear lock holds firm while sports activities. You can remove those ear lock silicon holders if not running or sports activities. It's optional, it depends upon one's usage For a cool nifty tip use a paper clip to hold the plug wires firmly togather while excercises like pushups, crunches. It is likely to fall off your neck if you do these exercises. I hope in next version of this ear heads the company will notice it for it's boAtHeads fans. View my uploaded pics for details."
116,5.0,"This is my 2 set of boat rockers 255 . It's one of the best Bluetooth earphones you can buy for 1000 bucks . The sound quality is Great . Battery back up is ok works for 6 hours only on a single change . The Bluetooth connectvity is strong , does face some issues at time it happens once in 20 days may be but works fine . The battery indicator on the phone shows incorrect battery life it's drains perfectly from 100% to 50 % after which the battery goes dead . However I don't feel that's any issue . Coz it's works exactly 6 hours as advertised on the box . Noice cancelation is okok you are still able to hear outside sounds
. overall Great product ."
117,1.0,"I’ve been using this for past few months now.

At first glance, the product seems good and because it does its purpose as wireless audio earphone.

Operation wise, there are few things that annoys me a lot.

1. During charging there’s no LED indicator. So sometimes if cable is loose or something you won’t know that it’s not charging.

2. The on/off switch is not UX friendly. you can’t tell by touch if you’re pressing volume buttons or power button. All Buttons are diamond shaped. Extremely annoying when you’re in a hurry.

3. The Bluetooth pairing is not intuitive. You have to switch on phone Bluetooth and then the earphone. If you switch on the earphone and then the phone Bluetooth, the earphone won’t initiate pairing(I know it’s not the problem with iPhone, because my previous Bluetooth used to work this way) . This is very stupid. So you have to re-start the earphone.

4. Double press on volume buttons doesn’t perform next/previous function. Other earphones are capable of this very basic function.

5. Occasional buzz or distortion. Sometimes there is a buzzing distortion. On restart of the earphone it goes away.

6. Poor Battery level indicator: if the battery level is full, then you’d be rest assured that you’ll have battery power for 2-3 hrs.
If the level is less than full e.g 80-90%, you can expect battery to run out in around 2 hrs.
So, the battery level indicator is not true indicator of actual battery level. Which means, you always keep it 100% charged if you don’t wanna risk running out of battery."
118,3.0,"First impression:
Just unpacked and pairing was very easy. I was able to pair this to my OnePlus 5T and Laptop. After pairing my phone first, I switched off the bluetooh in phone and paired with my PC. Then switched on the bluetooth in phone. Played music from PC and when I received a call in my phone, the headset goes silent and the music automatically pauses. Exactly the way I wanted. However, one drawback is that when the phone call ends, the music doesnt resume automatically.

Sound Quality is good - Good bass - Comfortable to wear

Suggestion for the manufacturer:
As soon as the device is paired, not sure why the voice says ""You plugged into Nirvana""?
And instead of referring the connected device name, the headphone voice says ""You are connected to Boat Rockerz"".. Shouldnt this be the name of the connected device..(Mobile name or the laptop name)?"
119,4.0,"Worth buying this product if you have a limitted budget of 1.5 K

Just to note this earphone comes with bluetooth v 4.1 and CSR 8635 chipset, but there is a confusion with amazon itself... in desc its mentioned 4.1 however in pictures its shown as 4.2.. The seller is selling us version 4.1. Please amazon correct it!! Customers would face the loss in case of any mis communication.

Talking about build quality, sound clarity and looks
I personally liked it.. Bass is really good no noise while hearing. If you are listening into a good melody songs you would dive into the music. Look wise as depicted in pictures it looks different from the black and red..

I use for jogging and excersise and the fit is good.. it won't get dropped off.

Battery is ok I am getting around 6 hrs in a one full charge. Battery capacity could have been increased at least to 10 hrs by Boat. But no worries..."
120,5.0,"I had bought this earphone for my brother for his office use. Below are experiences:

1> The noise cancellation is quite good.
2> the voice quality is also great. I can hear people well and they can hear me well.
3> The band is light weight and do not feel like a weight on my neck.
4> Good to hear songs while running. The sweat do not affect the band.
5> The talk time is superb and covers my office time. With one full charge it can go for 10-12 hours.

All I can say is I am happy with the product and I recommend you to buy this product if need be without any doubt."
121,5.0,"Writing this review while listening to music with this awesome earphone. Got this in prime day sale in just 999/- which itself is a great deal. I have used Boat basshead 225 earphone and Boat rockers 400 earlier but this is better than both of them. Comfortable, lightweight, superb bass, great noise cancellation, no issue with pairing with my Android device. Sound clarity is ok. I will review it again after a month of use."
122,4.0,"Boat rockerz BT headphone.

1. Product quality is decent. Sound quality is good. Works perfectly as an in-ear headphone, as you won't hear much outside noise or even outside sounds once you're plugged in.

2. You will hear audio assists when you switch it on, pair it to Bluetooth, switch off etc. That is a good feature.

3. Placement of the earpiece is problematic. I found it difficult to place it initially, but I figured it out later. Now, after 3-4 days of use, my ear hurts because I have been placing them in ear. So that's a bad thing.

4. I noticed that the headset attracts a lot of dust when used. So on the black headset, you can see dust particles sticking on."
123,3.0,"Well my review is after using this bluethooth earphone for 2 weeks.
1. Bass quality is very nice...mass songs music lovers will love ethe bass it produce
2.Build quality is also very will.mat finished
The buttons provide to operate songs and answering calls worked well.
3. Range of the bluethooth is good which covers a room completely
5.batter is very bad...if u use it for 2 hrs continually it will dead.
And the battery percentage showing 100% for and hr and post which it falls to 80 and it will dead in next 30 min
Over all sound quality is not up to the mark...you will miss something it quality of songs.
6. Call quality is not bad but some times u have to bring the Mike portion little frount while speaking
And one day I was listening to musice and I got a call. But I can hear both voices 1 is the person who speaking to me and on background I can hear songs....that is the worest part with this earphone....
Over all my opinion is to go with any other earphone with little more budjet (JBL )."
124,5.0,"Purchased in sale worth Rs 999 so it was Great deal and all things like battery backup to sound quality is Great and superb in this price range.

Best waepon for gym warriors.

Just charge for half an hour and play upto 6 hours.

Sometime when have a call its lagging like breaking voice but overall nice noice cancellation.

Apart from all great deal in Rs 999 earphones with Bluetooth and the button controls."
125,5.0,"The bass and sound clearity is just awesome..very comfortable...call quality is also awesome...but the battery seems not ok.
I got the product delivered yesterday after unboxing the product I noticed that the battery was 100% I have continuously used it for like 2-3 hours and the battery % came down to 80% again I have used it for like 2hours and the battery was still 80%.

Day 2,
In the morning I used it again for like 30 minutes suprisingly the battery was still 80% I was just amazed.
Later I dint use it till the evening.
Later on at 7 I used it continuously till 9 pm and yes the battery was still 80%.

Here the real problem occurs after the my dinner I was relaxing in the balcony and was on a phone call suddenly I started getting beep sounds from my new boat 255 earphones and the I checked the battery% it was 20% I was like whaaattttt!! seriously!! Like 5mins before it was still 80% and out of nowhere suddenly it went down to 20% this really pissed me off and within 30 seconds battery down totally dead...horrible.
I'll check it again tomorrow if I still the same problem persist I'll have to replace the item between the build quality, sound, call quality is really good.

That's all for now amigos."
126,4.0,"I bought it in Jan-2019 & it stopped working in May-2019.
Build quality is good & sound quality was also pretty good.
But it stopped working & charging. If I charge it for whole night then it is only usable for few minutes & then it is turned off.
I claimed warranty & they took my old one & reolaced it with new one. boAt after serviced is very good, I'm impressed. They came to my home & took the defective product & replaced it with new one. It took around 10-15days to get a new one."

Unavailability of service centers at major cities.

I have been a fan of boat products. Used boat earphone, Bluetooth headphone, Sound bar as well but this time got very dissatisfied with Boat Rockerz 255. Donot recommended at all"
128,3.0,"well, i have brought this product four months back... good buy.. i brought it for 1499/-
i would suggest to buy this at this price which is currently stating..999/-
sound quality is good what all i needed, apart from this battery life is enough good around 6 hrs.
In 4 months right side is not working... now i want to replace this immediately as this is something not expected...really not satisfied with it...
giving 3 stars as its good in sound & battery.."
129,3.0,"Wrote a much longer review but the page reset so I am not re-typing- The bass was good (bass lovers might enjoy it..) but a bit too high/heavy for my liking and so it tends to drown out/reduce the clarity of other instruments and the vocals at times too. Similar to the MDR and XB Sony ranges as far as the bass and overall output goes. The battery life is decent at about 6 hours listening at 70-80% + of the max volume. The wireless range was also decent and can be put at approximately 15 feet max - but with say two walls in between (so it might be a little more minus the walls..). The magnetic lock seems to work just fine, have not really tested the microphone much- the widened neckband is great and gives the earphones stability on the neck. My main issue came down to the life span of the product- I thought the build quality and durability was above average but then this happened- Bought this a few months ago but I left it pretty much sealed and untouched in its box (I continued to use my Apple and Skullcandy wired earphones-the sound quality on the Apple pods is still brilliant so I still use the wired ones over wireless earphones whenever possible/not too inconvenient) - so I only started to use the Boat earphones a month or two ago and well- the left earpiece is already malfunctioning and had almost stopped outputting any audible sound on a few occasions now. I did tend to use the earphones at 80% plus of the max volume but if that is the cause for failure then the earphones obviously are not engineered as well as claimed. Now the volume of the left earpiece is softer and less clear than the right- and has faded away completely on occasions that I have tried to listen to music for a stretch of about 4 hours on 80% volume or such- I am just trying to keep the volume low at the moment so that the earpiece does not stop emitting sound completely again- will have no choice but to get in touch with their customer service if the issue persists and see what they say- but the only conclusion I can draw from my experience thus far is that these earphones lack even say Skullcandy's durability which at least use to last almost a year even when used for long stretches of time at about 80-90% of the upper volume limit for music etc."
130,4.0,"Good Bluetooth in the ear headphones....Sound quality is decent....may seem a little thin, takes time to get used to, but definitely not bad or poor.
Battery life too is decent( around 5-6 hrs) when connected.
Build quality is good, though you need to b a little careful.
All in all a VALUE FOR MONEY deal ( especially sweet since I got it at an attractive deal price of INR 999 during the Great Indian Amazon Sale)."
131,4.0,"To the point,
PROS:
1. The sound quality is good. The bass is sometimes too much, clarity is compromised. But most of the times, it does pretty good job.
2. Pairing and range is superb. Upto 5 meters even 6 it does not cut if no obstacles. Comes handy in gym where i move away from the phone.
3. Ansering calls/speaking is very convenient, and because of the band the mouth piece is at the right position for calls.

CONS:
1. The band is a nuisance in gym when you're running, doing pushups etc, it keeps falling away. Cannot secure it tightly during workouts. Wearing on the head is temporarily okay.
2. The fitting of the ear piece is not correct. With the same sized ear tips my other earphones fit very snugly. This one keeps falling off my ears.
3. Although the sound quality is good, the clarity is not great if you're concerned about crisp music. The sound is loud and bass is good, but the clarity of music is average.

Finally, for this price, This is the best on Amazon."
132,5.0,"I tried 3 bluetooth headsets (Samsung Level U which is not so durable, 2 of JBL) and boat rockerz255 is the best pick i must say considering the pricing (bought is for 999, i know you can get it at even better price sometimes). Steady, Durable and Decent Quality of music. Recommended for Bikers, Cyclists, who want decent music and wireless headsets. Someone like music geek or who is looking for bass, amazing music this may not be good pick though. ""Thank You Boat"", you are one among few Indian companies which has flourished in recent past, please continue making good products and make us feel proud."
133,1.0,"The battery lasts approximately 4 hours if continuously used. The sound quality is good. Noise cancellation is okie. The neck band is flexible which is exactly what I wanted. I roll the headphones easily to put them in a case. The wire is very flexible and good quality.
Overall a good product. BUT.....
16/10/2019 Dowgraded the rating after few months of use...
the right side headphone volume has automatically reduced. Can hardly hear anything in right side unless volume is turned on full. Disappointed with this defect."
134,5.0,"Close your eyes and just go for it. It is amazing at its price. I have got it at a festival sale which costs me 999 rupees. Mic quality is decent and battery life is about 6-7 hours of playback. Product design is good and very durable. The best feature is the sound quality and its design. Light but well built, doesn't feel bulky.Bluetooth works flawlessly.Really like the base and sound quality for this price. It's good to listen to music. I have a Bose 300 QC but I'm using this on a day to day basis as carrying QC wherever I go is not practical. I going this headphone is quite enough for my music need . The microphone is working as expected.The noise cancellation is quite good.They were very easy to set up initially and easy to operate. It's a very light weight earphones don't go on my words you will feel when you take it in your hands.Thank you for such a great service in such a competitive market.Purchased in sale worth Rs 999 so it was Great deal and all things like battery backup to sound quality is Great and superb in this price range.Best waepon for gym warriors.I tried 3 bluetooth headsets (Samsung Level U which is not so durable, 2 of JBL) and boat rockerz255 is the best pick i must say considering the pricing (bought is for 999, i know you can get it at even better price sometimes). Bass lovers, u can expect an average bass as compared to a precious earphones. U can adjust bass through Equalizer if u need more bass."
135,4.0,"This is an average bluetooth headset and serves the purpose. And justifies the cost. Many of the music components are unvalued and heigher frequency sounds quality are suffering. Most focus on 20 HZ to 500HZ I guess.

But if you are music lover and and can't compromise with the quality the spend bit extra please better do it or go for. I used Sennheiser for five years and dropping to this headset is kind of shocking and learning to adjust."
136,1.0,"I bought one recently and below was my experience :
1) the wireless range is very low.
2) battery life isn't good either.
3) boat is known for it's bass, but this one's bass was terribly unpleasant.

Final verdict : Don't buy it. Better go for Mi sports basic headsets that 's much better and has a balanced sound. Or if you have a good budget, go with the Jays t-Four or RHA, they are just WOW!!"
137,4.0,"the product is all over good in this price
i got it in freedom sale for ₹999
sound quality is awesome
bass is also good
no connectivity issues
no discomfort to the ears
battery backup is of 6-7 hours
charging time is 1.5-2 hour for full charge
you can use them for half hour after 10 minute charging
but . . . the only thing i hate about these earphones is their BEEP sound
every time i play a video it beeps if i pause the video it beeps and on instagram while scrolling posts if a video comes up it beeps there also and on next video post it beeps again and while scrolling stories on snapchat/insta it beeps there also
OVERALL its awesome but i hate this BEEP"
138,2.0,"I have further reduced it to 2 stars as there is connectivity issues. While listening to music it suddenly disconnects and connects .... Sometimes it does not connect at all ... then i have to re-pair the device as a new device
The first product i received did not have the mic wokring and the sound quality was very bad especially in one year the sound was higher than the other one. The replacement i got is working fine. The only problem i notice is when i am walking the connectivity seems to be patchy. The song starts breaking up but after sometime it's ok. I notice this when i go for more than an hour of walking. I have both the boat and realme earphone both have their advantages, personally i like the realme slightly more than boat"
139,4.0,"I was so amazed for as to get this one. I acquired a same day delivery. The build quality is top notch, it feels rugged and strong; the wires and the earpiece felt wonderful. Yet, the thing I'd like to regret is it is not as light as the Boult wireless headphones. This is a bit heavy. I specifically bought it for gym as I have three JBL for home and office purposes. So in gym, while on a workout, you can definitely feel the a light weight on your ears.

Also, I feel that the wires should be length adjustable as in a Boult headphone. I feel the wires are a bit lengthy. But, this definitely is a better choice than Boult. I compared it with my friends Boult headphones. This one was the best in sound quality, build quality and all.

Secondly, the noise cancellation is absurd. Not upto the mark, not even as good as other earphones of this price. But the other qualities like sound, strength, battery, Bluetooth connectivity, all rocks in this headphones. To this price range, this is wonderful."
140,4.0,I rated the earphones 4 out if 5 just because i am looking at them without considering their price. If I were to include its price in the equation then it'll be probably 7 out of 5. Yes it's that good in it's price range. What caught me off guard is it's call clarity. I take a ton of voice call on these and the other parties never complained about the call clarity. If you receive a lot of calls on a Bluetooth earphone then you can't go wrong with these. Other than that you don't need to read this review further where I could complain about an over emphasized bass and muddied mids and highs....just watch a few videos on YouTube and you'll be good to go..... Battery life is decent. Call clarity is pretty dope. That's all I have to add on
141,4.0,"Built quality, Sound Quality, Noise Cancellation, Voice commands, Call quality everything is just perfect BUT biggest drawback is Battery backup. When 60% left and you start using within few mins it directly falling to zero. Which is really pessimistic. However it takes couple days of moderate usage to reach 80% so overall it's a bang for buck. I strongly recommend to go for this sportive wireless headsets."
142,1.0,"Ive been regularly purchasing boat earphones products since a long time. From wired to wireless and this was my first wireless earphone. Sound quality is good but the problem is, it didnt lasted more than a year and left bud just died. It usually happens boat products lasts around a year or so, but this one lasting 8 months was a surprising.

Read warranty information, and this should be covered in warranty. Created a ticket on their support website. Received ticket number and email mentioning the pickup process proving the return shipment details and the waybill number. Problem is, it never got pickup up since a week. Here is the ordeal

- You would receive a message for couple of days intimating pickup and executive number. Executive never comes for pickup. When trying to reach on his number, it says incoming is disabled on this number. SMS cannot be sent on this number. Overall you can never reach on this number.
- When you email the courier company, you would receive standard email that it will be taken care or responded back within 24 to 48 hours but nobody cares to respond back
- When you call the courier company number it never accepts the AWB or your mobile number
- When you try to email Boat Support, again standard response to follow support website for complaint. Now, the website has only two options to create complaint or to check status.
- When you call boat support, option 1119 will take to customer care execute. I doubt if any real person exists to take your call as it always keeps you on hold for 2 minutes and says all executives busy and we will reach you later and sooner but nobody ever calls.
- You just have to follow madly but you cannot reach anyone here.

All together, BoAt products sound good at consumer level but lack quality and now I think they are designed that way, not to survive for long, so you keep buying new ones every year. A desi chinese product company. The support is nothing but sham. A product which doesnt build to survive for long enough isnt a good choice, and I would recommend to buy something better with your hard earned money. WIll keep updating further progress if they would care to attend the service request complaint or not."
143,5.0,"Before stating it's pros and cons, I would like to say that I've used Sennheiser Cx180 before this which just broke down after satisfactory use of more than 2 yrs. So I'll be comparing sound quality of this with that.

*Pros*
→ Lightweight
→ Superb sound quality
→ Attractive & durable design
→ Good Battery life
→ Google assistant/Siri
→ Tangle free wire with magnetic heads
→ Sweat proof

*Cons*
→ Though Bass is awesome, you can find a bit compromise in mids & high, but you won't be able to notice this unless you compare it with some high end headphones.
→ Poor Packing from Amazon, not even bubble wrap?
→ Slight pain in ear if you wear it for long.

*Overall verdict*
9/10
Just go for it if you want Bluetooth headphones for ₹1.5k, you are not getting any better than this."
144,3.0,"Bought this for gifting purpose for a friend. Came ultra damaged first time. The Box was fully crushed. Returned.
Got the replacement item, it was again all crushed. Looked like someone has thrown this a 100 times. Thought to give it a try, but the structure of the ear plugs is not good. Specially the extra rubber which is there to hold in place. Within 10 mins, your mind goes from music to 'whats pocking in my ears'.
Overall, a bad experience.
Built quality : 8/10
Sound quality : 7/10 (if you are a Sennheiser user)
Battery life : 9/10
overall for the price : 8.5/10

Edit: Had gifted one to a friend just 2 months back, and its not working on one side now. Raised a warranty claim with BOAT, and they said would replace it with a new one at no extra cost. But, this may take 20-30 days."
145,4.0,"Good headphones but same price range Mi Sports is also available.

Everything is good both of headphones and its a neckband headphones and Mi Sports is not.

Sound quality is Best in Mi Sports

Loud Sound is in boat.

Mi Sports can fold and you can put into your pocket easily.

But Boat Has Magnetic Lock system and its hold on your neck and this feature is not available in Mi Sports.

If you looking for smooth sounds, good bass , good battery life then go for Mi

If you looking for Safety reasons, louder sound, magnetic lock, then go for Boat.

If you have any questions then fell free ask i will answer all of you questions."
146,4.0,"In terms of price range it is a good earphone but not the best one. Sound quality is good, no issues with battery life and also feels very comfortable around your neck. Sometimes the connection was breaking while you are travelling by vehicle but it is not a big issue as it happens rarely. The only thing that I did not liked was the length of cable. It was really a bit long that can make some disturbance to you especially when you are not listening to music and casually hangs it from your neck. However the magnetic effect was working very fine."
147,5.0,"These headphones are such a good deal! I bought these at ₹999 during prime sale.
- Excellent performance for a low cost!
- They are very comfortable to wear, I hardly notice me wearing these headphones.
- They were very easy to set up initially and easy to operate.
- The sound quality is excellent! I think the design look great too!

I had no problem with syncing them to my Pixel 2XL and they stay synced even when I walk away from my phone for up to a distance of 30 ft.
I am very happy with the long battery life, since I can be forgetful about charging my various devices.

I sweat a lot and that has not affected their performance so far and from what I read in other reviews, it will not be a problem in the future either.

All in All, I very much recommend these headphones!

Great performance for a low price!"
148,3.0,"The range of Bluetooth is very low. It does not work properly if you are in a different room. Sound quality is good however, during calls there is fluctuation. The person onnthe other end of a call always complain about the irritating noise coming from the earphone, which I cannot hear. To confirm it, I asked my friend to record the call. After listening btobthe recorded call, I could hear some sound like tak-tak-tak. My colleague does not have this issue though. I cannot use it for a longer period of time since my ears start having pain.

Otherwise, it a good earphone. Good to buy at this rate."
149,4.0,"A month ago, I bought RealMe Wireless Headset and It’s Bass and Game-Latencies were pathetic, I returned it immediately.

But here, You can clearly feel the BASS and for GAMES like PUBG and COD the audio latency is minimal (compared to RealMe)

So if you’re a BassHead and wanted to use this for gaming with low latency this is the best headset in Rs.1000-4000 Segment.

I have listed the audio latency details below

My Device: iPhone 7

Boat Rockerz 255 (Rs.1300):
• PUBG - Classsic 0.2 to 0.5Sec delay
TDM - 0.5 to 0.7Sec delay
• COD - 0.5Sec delay (both Multiplayer & BR)

RealMe Wirelesss (Rs.1799):

• COD - Multiplayer 1 to 1.2Sec delay
Battle Royale - 1Sec delay"
150,4.0,"I love music. In my phone you will find music ranging from Mozart to Linkin Park. And for the purpose of enjoying my music I have used various earphones (Sony, JBL, Skull Candy, Sennheiser etc.), but this is my first bluetooth earphones (a birthday gift from my wife) and after using it for 4 days, here I am sharing my detailed review...

1. Build Quality ~ Very good. It's very lightweight, but doesn't seem to be fragile. (4.5/5)

2. Sound Quality ~ Absolutely brilliant. I had seen many YouTube reviewers claiming that the Bass is this overpowers all the tiny sounds, but that's compeletely wrong. (4.5/5)

3. Bass + Treble ~ The balance is quite fine, and if your music player has an equalizer you can tweak the balance according to your liking. (4.5/5)

4. Comfort ~ These are lightweight as I have already mentioned, so it is a given that they are comfortable, even when using for hours. But personally, I have found that the left ear hook doesn’t fit as comfortably as the right one. You can remove the ear hooks though! (4/5).

5. Battery backup ~ For me it has been more than 4.5 hours. (4/5)

6. Pairing ~ As easy as it gets. (5/5)

7. Noise Cancellation ~ Great. (5/5)

I got it for ₹1199 and I can confidently recommend this to you. 🙂"
151,5.0,"Just got this and I must say that the build quality is great. Coming to the sound it has really good bass. Can't comment of the battery yet as I just got it. I will update the review later after checking the battery backup.
Edit: So, after using it for few days, the battery easily lasts for a day and half a per my usage which includes 1-1.5 hrs of music, one movie (1.5-2hrs) and one episode of Tv series (40-50mins). I end a with 40% battery left as per above usage."
152,4.0,"I got it during Independence sell @999 (excluding 199 rs. Discount.
I m waiting this review after 3 weeks of use.
Sound volume: I m using realme mobile and I feel that sound volume is little bit low.
Sound quality: It depends on device. When I use it with my PC, sound is ossm. Also it give good bass in mobile.
Looks and materials: definitely it is good and longevity is high. But it could better if available neck band as boult provide. Other issue is that there is no vibration,so sometimes you will miss the call when earpiece is not in ear.
Battery life: charging time is 2 hour approximately. After fully charge, you can enjoy 5:30 hours battery backup.
All over no any other issue till now.
If your budget is around 999 rs, you can definitely go with it..."
153,5.0,"This product is very good. I say, best at available price. And moreover, the customer support is impressive. Had an issue with one side earphone not working after 7 months of usage. BoAt replaced me the product with a brand new one. This is what delights the Customer.

Thank you for such a great service in such a competitive market.

And with my verbal marketing, 8 of my office colleagues, family members bought this product and they too have a best experience with positive feedback.

Thank you BoAt once again for the great product and service offered."
154,3.0,"The boAt Rockerz 225 sport earphones are not worth for sports or specifically for running on tread mill
We can hear our feets stamping on the tread mill
It means noise cancellation is not there at all
Your head as well as ears will feel heavy after using it for 15 to 20 minutes on tread mill
The ear plugs are not at all comfortable nor soft for ears
I bought them like others who were the prey of marketing tactics and then found that it was a great mistake should have gone with other better ones which some of my friends are using like targus which are more comfortable in the ear
Fellows its your will and your hard earned money and you are wise enough to decide
Cheers!"

The previous one from boat was boat rockerz 400 whose sound quality with bass was just fabulous but call quality dissapointed me but this one really is excellent...

Another problem which i noticed was very seldom bluetooth connectivity issue."

I buy this in just 999 rupees and I love this to be very Frank if you are getting this in 1000 or 1100 rupees it is value for money and basically those who are playing games and need headphones with the surround sound this is basically for you guys only because I used to many products and which generally legging the sound or you can say the sound delay I am using airpods as well. To be very Frank it make sound delays and that was around 10 times more expensive from this. And the conclusion is this is the best product you can buy in 1100 buks"

It can connect two devices at a time so pairable with mobile and laptop together is a huge advantage.
With a full charge, i get more or less 8 hours of battery life
connects easily without wasting time with my mobile phone."
161,5.0,I am not sure on people commenting no deep bass...but it works perfectly with my Samsung Galaxy A50 and Sony Xperia XA Ultra....tried on stock music app (brand provided) and third party music app its just awsome bass...high and low nodes are too perfect...got at 899 in offer...build quality is also good...and button placement makes easy to use...all control on the buttons...
162,1.0,Pathetic quality
163,2.0,"Pros: Bluetooth connectivity is good
Cons:
- Pumps in that unnecessary extra bass for everything and you can't turn it off. Really a huge turn off for me because they forcefully try to make music ""sound good"" while totally distorting how it's actually intended to be heard. Hurt my ears in the beginning. I am regretting spending money on this.
- Battery life shows 80% and suddenly drops to 20% out of nowhere and doesn't really last long enough to show for that 20%. Keeps saying ""battery is low"" while I am listening to music and no way to turn this off as well.

Do decide if you will be alright with ""modified"" sound output which makes music ""sound better"" before ordering this."
164,3.0,"I bought this boAt rockerz 255 on my friends suggestion, hez using these for a quit while now say months... Whn i ordered i got a defective one...mic issue...crackling sound, buzzing noise.., So replaced it. Now coming to the review, the sound is OK OK at this price range, battery works fine but the more u use u know the electronic products the work time reduces.. they mentioned 6hrs but for me..5hrs max. Again it depends u see. Easy to use.. some devices tale time to settle as i said my 1st defective product , ot took min to settle down n give a good sound.. untill thn u hv to bear with crackling sounds buzzing noise..(i said with some devices not all, u shld b lucky to gt a gud product at 1st time or else replace/return). Wire is a bit lengthy though if u dn hv a problm with tht, then its fine. Buttons are on right side so difficult to operate while riding bike as we hv accelerator on right side. Overall OK product at this price... Atleast its better than boult curve band/ boult probass space. And now my friend got an issue with his boAts mic... Hv to see how long my boAt will be in condition.

Sound quality - 4/5
Noise cancellation - 3/5
Moisture wicking - 3/5

REVIEW ON 8th March 2020
Facing some issues with Mic - voice assistants not responding when i say hey/ok google, hey cortana..
Charging is ok
Hearing Some crisp disturbnce sounds, sound quality a bit lowered...
Very difficult to maintain this band around neck while riding..
Sound volume levels got lowered a bit.."
165,5.0,This Bluetooth earphone is just a beast ! It has amazing bass ! Sound quality is just mind blowing ! This product is value for money ! Suggeste you to buy these if you are looking for amazing earphones under rs 2500 . These earphones have a very good range and provide a usage time of 7 hrs on a charge of 45 to 60 mins .
166,5.0,"The sound output is great. The built quality 8s also looks good. The battery backup is absolutely phenomenal.
The brand is also very reliable. They will provide free pickup if you will face any problem within the warranty period. I got this product at 999/- only 😌"
167,4.0,"I have this and boat rockers 255, so i m giving a comparison here. Believe me guys this is not at all compared with the boat one. The bass is excellent in boat, where as this does not have at all. I saw the rating and bought it, but please don't get fooled by the name JBL. The sound quality in this is same as a roadside 50 rupees earphone. I paid 800 more for this than the boat, but repented. Only pro in this is the earpieces are lightweight compared to boat one, whereas the holders in boat gives a nice support to hold the ear pieces. Rest any feature you compare the boat exceeds at par."
168,4.0,"Well first things first...it's boAt..so don't expect it to perform like BOSE...
Bluetooth... I initially had some issues with setting it up with my mobile, but eventually things got sorted out...
Sound Quality....it's ok nothing great...can't compare it to any other brand like JBL, Sony etc...because I didn't pay that much...
In the Ear fit...now that's the real issue with it...it would never fit properly...no matter how hard I try...keeps falling off...
So overall...go for it if Ur budget is less than 1k...otherwise I would suggest to go for a better device from Sony or Samsung or JBL...."
169,5.0,"These are best Bluetooth Earphones available in market till now if you grab it in 1K in any sale of Amazon.

*The Sound Quality is fabulous.
*The body of band is plastic build but it's very durable enough,no need to think about it's toughness.
*It fits in 👂 perfectly without giving pain to your ears.
*The connectivity is also decent, it can pair with 2 devices simultaneously (laptop & smartphone) , whenever you turn it on, if the last paired device is near to it, it will connect to it quickly.
*It supports Google assistant or any other you use in your smartphone.
*And guess what it even works pretty well with your keypad phone😅.
*Battery life is decent as well (will easily last for a working day on a full charge)
*Bass is definitely the best in this one.

So if you are looking forward to buy a Bluetooth Earphone for the first time , you should definitely without any thought go wmfor this one carrying the Brand name of BOAT & many good user reviews/experiences like of mine."
170,3.0,"This is an Average product with decent bass and acceptable noise cancellation

Pros
1.Its was on sale for 800 , so price is definitely leaning towards the buy factor
2.Noise cancellation is decent
3.charge holds good for about 6 hours for continuous usage

Cons
the product has a qualcomm chip which is supposed to give these headphones the much needed bass and treble however at slightly higher volume its all garbled up.
Next, the biggest issue which i saw was the headphone switching on off leaving a hum when no music was playing. This was really annoying as its noise cancellation headphones.

If you have the budget the go for the JBL earphones as they are much better."
171,4.0,"Overall it's good(3.9/5)
Sometimes I feel bass is too much
If you are sleeping on bed and listening music for some long time you will feel little uncomfortable near neck (bcoz of material of band)
But I don't say it is the best if you can spend some more money then you can choose REALME WIRELESS earphones which are better than this one"
172,3.0,Not an hour has passed and I started disliking boat rockers headphones . It's poor connectivity that is the main reason. I tried it over call and played music but it has poor connectivity. On call it has a reach of meters only which is very less this means we have to carry phone in pocket everytime. While playing music it has connectivity upto 6-7 meters but if you change rooms in-between the connection loses. Though sound quality is good. Overall product is average though is also cheap. So a nice tradeoff. I give 3 star .
173,4.0,"I'll break down my review into 4 parts : Sound quality, noise cancellation and calls(mic), battery and ergonomics

Sound quality:
For the price range of 1.2k, ( I got it for 900 rupees during 2019 Dasara sale ) the quality of sound is pretty crisp. There is a slight overtone to Bass while the other elements are balanced. Personally, I think this balance is perfect. Given the pricing, I'd rate 5/5 for sound quality.

Noise cancellation:
For the pricing range, I'd say the noise cancellation is pretty decent. Somewhere close to half volume your noise cancellation works seamlessly while listening to music. On the other hand, when I'm on calls, the noise cancellation is pretty poor. People often tell me that they're clearly able to listen to all the talk and noise and honking etc, from the background but not my voice. So I have to pull the mic closer to my lips to be audible enough to eliminate background noise. So, I'd give 3/5 for noise cancellation.

Battery:
I play music at a pretty low volumes (some 3 button presses lower than half volume) So, the battery can easily last upto 6 hrs. If I'm watching a movie or TV series, it'll last for 7-8 hours. The charging time is pretty nominal. I charge it from 6:45 am to 8:15 am and it would have gone from 0 to full charge. You could charge it with a 2.1 A adapter for a much quicker charge but I don't know if the earphones can handle that current without getting damaged in the long run (read the institution manual). So, at this pricing, I'd give battery a 4/5

Ergonomics:
I must say, my favourite part is the magnetic lock. It's convenient and you can simply wear it around your neck like a necklace. It's easy to tuck it under your collar and keep it locked when not using. Looks sturdy though I don't wish to test it ! One disadvantage would be that that wire is a little too long and that wasn't necessary. It's bulky and unlike other BT earphones, you can't throw them in a bag, you'll need to be careful where you put it. If the ear hooks are positioned correctly, you should have no pain around the ear cartilage while wearing them for long durations. I wear it 2.5 hrs a day to work and I rarely feel irritated or pain around the ear. So, I'd give ergonomics and overall comfort a 3/5

Combining the ratings for all the above mentioned parameters, the overall eating turns out to be a 4/5 for this pricing which is pretty decent I'd say. Whenever it's on offer (under 1000 bucks) and you want a pair of BT earphones, simply go for it. I can absolutely vouch for it."
174,4.0,"Dear All,

Let me write the genuine review of this product.

The product was delivered on time,

Guys, I am using this product since 2 last month and I have discovered an excellent product.

The product is much better as compare to other costly international brands.

Likes :
* Excellent bass
* Noise cancellation support
* Value for money

Dislikes:
* I expect more form the local brand in terms of quality of material used e.g. plastic quality and packaging box.

Overall suggestion you buy with this price..!"
175,4.0,"I had been using it for more than week now. 1) Audio quality is good,
2) When I put it around neck, I don't feel it is there.
3) But for some reason after long hours of usage ears started paining. I removed ear loop hooks and changed the ear phone tips to smallest size. Now I am able wear them for little longer.
4) During call I checked with caller about noise and call audio quality. They didn't complain.
5) 3 buttons can be felt easily when you are wearing them. Accepting calls is easier with middle button and other 2 buttons are volume up and down bottons.
6) With long press and saying ""OK google"", google assistant can be activated."
176,4.0,"I have used the product for more than 4 months... and just started feel like I'm using it for few hours..this is my impression..first I'm a Boat head..and has been using themvfor the last couple of years..I have discarded my earlier JBLand Philips head phones long back...I'm extremely impressed by boAt 225 edition...just awesome and I am comparing this 255 Bluetooth to the 225..
First Bluetooth connectivity is very good and easily covers 10 feet...build is ok but needs a good look...second sound quality may not be like the wired ones (I am slightly disappointed)..voice clarity using microphone is good ( little disappointed) noise cancellation is better compared to 225... finally battery quality is good ..will surely run for 7-9 hours depending on use...bass quality is good..not better than 225..HD sound is impressive..
For other Boat heads..if I am wrong let me know
Sound quality-3.5/5
Build quality-3.5/5
Bluetooth connectivity-4/5
Noise cancellation-3/5
Over all 3.5/5..
Boat please improve the quality..for new buyers it's satisfactory but not overwhelming at this price..good luck"
177,4.0,"I got it @ 999/- on the day after i ordered it. Sound quality is not the best but good, extra bass is available which somehow destroy the lows and mids. but decent at this price range. battery back up is also good. i have not charged it,already used it 3-4 hours at mid volume. Call quality is also good.overall a good package from Boat, you can go for it.
only con is the bluetooth range. it is very disappointing. if you roam about in the house keeping your phone on your room the connection gets lost!
otherwise it is good overall!"
178,1.0,"Coming from sony XB-50, the audio quality is trash but bearable. The connectivity is really, really bad though. It connects really bad through a body so basically, if you are wearing some clothing layers and its in a backpack, connection drops. Even in a running arm band on the same side as receiver, the connection is lost a lot of times as it stutters. Place 1 finger over the receiver (the bony part of finger) and connection drops. It doesn't even have good connectivity for 10 cm much less 10 m.

If all you've done is used out of the box or cheapo chinese ubon headphones, these will be adequate but if you've ever paid for set of headphones before, this ain't it for you fam"
179,3.0,"Undoubtedly quick Bluetooth connectivity.
Portable light and affordable
Voice quality is good, liked the neon colour

Some issues I wanna discuss in detail
1. Earbuds don’t fit in ears, there’s no extra pair of earbuds lock, you loose them quick, it’s kinda cheap material

2. There’s no noice cancelled support and pre fed boat rockers dialogue are annoying

3 pretty bad battery! Doesn’t stand whole day gets drained in like 2 hours of constant music playing

Rest everything is fine! Battery is disappointing"
180,4.0,"after 3 days of use I am writing this review.. I have got it at Rs. 999.00
1) battery life almost 5 hours of music. not a problem for me.
2) built up quality good.
3) most importantly sound quality not awesome. may be good. if u like bass a great then good choice but vocal sound is seemed lower and sometimes not crystal clear. I have senheiser cx180 which costs rs.750. produces much crisp sound and bass.

but overall at rs. 999 it is a good deal."
181,4.0,"Amazon packaging : Not up to the mark, only comes in a plastic ploybag which is the outer bag, no internal protection per se!

Durability : looks sturdy, package also says sweat resistant, only delicate part is the charging port flap :P

Sound : it rockss!! Bass as well as trebles
One good thing is it wont let you increase the sound beyond a threshold via headphones ( u can do it from phone :P)

Noice cancellation is awesome.

Felt slightly more protruding, needs to be inserted deep into ear👂 otherwise chances of falling down ( not on the ground btw)

Package contains : charging cable 10-15 cm long, 2 pairs of buds of different sizes, warranty card + manual

Colour : red + black matt finish.

Its post delivery feedback so no idea of battery backup, charging, sweat proof. (Will add later)"
182,4.0,"It was delivered well before time.
Product was in good shape.
Best feature is its noise cancellation and how perfectly it fits in your ears.
Pros -
Very powerful bass.
Very good Noise cancellation.
Fits perfectly in ears.
Battery backup is very good.
Has voice command feature using which you can search change song or play specific song without touching your phone.
Desing is very comfortable and sit comfortably around the neck.
Light weight, you won't even feel if its around your neck or not.
Cons -
My last earphones were Sennheiser, and Sennheiser got the best voice clarity.
These are good in terms of bass but in term of voice clarity they don't stand against Sennheiser.

Over and all very good product. Quite satisfied with product at this price range. Bass is very powerful."
183,4.0,"Honestly First bummer was packaging.
It looks like it was already opened.
The package got little torn.. tape looks off the place. Also, earphones inside also didn't looked like fresh packaging. It really looks like It was used before.
but I could be wrong and it could be just bad packaging also.
sound is good though , average loud, but not very good. Range is good i can easily use it while moving in my house. You will always feel some disturbance while playing.
Also, I tried connecting with multiple devices but it can not be done while it's connected to other device. First, you gotta disconnect it then it can be connected."
184,3.0,"Product is good but service center is pathetic. After using headphones for 8 months one side of earphone stopped functioning. So we raised a complaint on boat website ( as that is the procedure to complaint and claim warranty ) on 18th sep we have raised complaint and today is 27th it is still pending. Calling up their customer care is a big task , first of all it is very difficult to get connected to their executive and if you are lucky u get to speak with them. But they will give false promises and pick up of your product doesn't happened either.

A product is good only if AFTER SALES SERVICE IS GOOD, otherwise people won't purchase it again."
185,3.0,"##READ IT BEFORE U BUY##

SOUND QUALITY not absolutely like HD.. Its Good as compared to others models or companies at the price u get.You need To do a lot of tweaks with eaqualizer in the device.
So i didn't like it. TREBLE IS LOW, MIDS ARE BIT GOOD BASS IS SUPERB BUT SUPRESSES ALL OTHER THINGS AND GIVES UNPLEASANT SOUND.
NOISE CANCELLATION not as per mentioned on the case. We still hear the things like TV @16VOLUME, HORNS OF BUS, LORRIES AND AUTOS. which actually disturbs ur feel towards music.
BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY... Its quite disappointing that even the phone is in my pocket the earphone shows some lag and complete loss of music for few seconds.. It never happened with the other two products i owned. (ALREADY I HAVE BOAT STONE 1000 and ROCKERZ 600 they are awesome in all circumstances at their price).
BOAT AUDIO is very good at aggressive pricing and quality but this product disappointed me.

****SO I RETURNED BOAT ROCKERZ 255...****"
186,3.0,"Review edit -after 3 months.
Buttons stopped working after 3 months.
Have to press hard to operate.
Product quantity is below acceptable level at this price point.

Amazing purchase.
Pros -
Sound (lows, highs, miss) good and acceptable.
Bass is amazing. Thump is good and feels like premium.
Ease of use - pairing is quick, everytime.
Cons -
Battery is a little bit below acceptable limit.
Helmet fit - possible if you have loose fitting helmet like Vega crux front opening helmet.
But not possible with Vega ryker/bolder series as these helmets have tight fit."
187,5.0,"It's good product while traveling.
Good sound quality, and noise cancellation.
The good thing about the device it's goes OFF after certain time if not used and when needed can switch it back ON and gets connected to phone automatically.
Good battery back up, approximately 8 hours(continuous-non stop-use) on including calls, videos, music player.
But the draw back may be on calls, the person on other end hears the other noises around us than what we speaks.
Other than that device is good and perfect."
188,3.0,"Pros :
1)Product quality good,sound good .
2)light weight
3)battery time /playback time over all good
4)connectivity average

Cons:
1)After 30 min yr ears feeling presure
2)Good connectivy when phone is in range
3)some times i feel the lil slage in connectivity while silenting music.
4) Its Not a product for daily bike commuters due to low noice cancellation.

Overall good product on bases of prices..."
189,5.0,"Well, I have been using these for a month now and the earphones are really good. The sound quality is immensely saturated. I could figure out the bass, treble and other modules separately. The bass is good for people who are not audiophiles. Like if you're not into sound recording or need minute details to grab onto, its perfect for you. I grabbed the deal in 1k though, so it was a nerve cracking deal for me. The battery lasts for 5 to 6 hrs for me even if I stay connected to the phone via Bluetooth without playing any music. It lacks the backup if I keep using it for listening to music for an hour or so and lasts for about 4.5 hrs or so. Mic quality is kinda okay clear but it catches too much of sounds of around you which can irritate the person on the other line. But on an average a great deal to get your hands on."
190,1.0,"I primarily use this headset for my daily bike ride to farm which is full of pot holes , trenches and bad roads. When I listen to music I tend to forget these obstacles and focus on my day to day goals. Day one use was okay. However now whenever I plug this with any of my Bluetooth device, I hear screeching sound just like old days mobile network coverage sound. I tried changing my mobile with other however problem continues. Also if you add another 500rs to will get jbl ones better than this boat rocker. Absolutely waste of money."
191,5.0,"Date: 17/12/2019
- Magnetic back stick to each other while hanging from neck. I usually hang the earphone crossed i.e. left in the right and right to the left and while wearing, I wear the ear pieces properly so that it crosses my neck. This helps the earphone not to fall from back due to wind while driving. I usually wear the earphone with helmet though.
- Auto switch off if not in use for quite some time.
- Good power usage. Lasts the whole day and 80% charge remains. I charge everyday as a custom.
- Microphone has great clarity but don't expect a condenser mic level sound.
- Can be used as a hidden mic for speaking in conferences.
- Nice placement of buttons for Volume up & down and pause & play.
- Nice audio feedback while powering on, connecting, connected, and switching off.
- LED blinking light while powering on, connecting, and switching off to know the present status of the headphone.
- Easily connected to laptop and other devices i.e. multi device connection and seamless switching between the audio playback from various devices. Preference given to laptop than mobile with mobile phone audio going to pause state.

**Update: 19/12/2019**
- Earphone turns off when connecting to both mobile and laptop. [Batter Charge: 80%]. First I connect to mobile, then connect to laptop, then earphone turns off. Previously this was not happening. It used to connect to multiple devices and play through each of them seamlessly depending on the output of the bluetooth audio input. Preference was given to laptop over mobile playback."
192,1.0,"I want to claim warranty....

I ve issue on my wireless bluetooth headset,
It was not working on right side from last night"
193,4.0,"After a week almost i would say that its most comfirtable and light weight.

Appearance is ok sporty touch and black colour looks professional too..

Comfirt in Ear, non slipy and proper fitting in Ear gives good noise cancellation.

Sound are good at vocal and music both.. Bass is as per other good haedphone and not so so much extra as mentioned here in other reviews and product discription.

Batery is ok for mderate use. Charge every day if use is more then 4- 5 hour in a day

Its very very good for routine listening of music and talk, but if you looking for party type sounds like other big headphone then its not suitable

And so is orice to be kept around 800-1000 thats too also due to brand"
194,5.0,"I've tested all BoAt RockerZ audio Product. This one i buy in diwali The great indian feastival sale.
Here's my review after using it for 15 days.

It has good sound quality with great design. The Bluetooth connectivity is also good. Batter backup is more then 4 days for continuing usage. Charges in 2 hrs.

Pros
Sound quality
Design
Bluetooth connectivity
Noise cancellation
Hd sound

Cons
Feels pain after usage of 1 hr
Magnet play/pause feature not include
Wire could be round"
195,3.0,"I had purchased my boat rockets in April 2019.
Pro's-
Fantastic music
Great calling quality
Great bass
Fantastic value for money.

Ffw - 6 months after usage of an hour each day for 5 days a week for 6 months -
The volume up and music skip button is not working
Registered a complaint with boat and they took the headphone and repaired it and delivered it back in 15 working days.
2 weeks later it does not charge anymore and I am loosing my cool.
I have registered my complaint again on the boat website for a repair.

Verdict -
Fantastic usage for 6 months with usage of 20 hours a month and approx 120 hours in 6 months.
Good for 6 months usage."
196,4.0,"Can't compare with sony or any other branded ones. But in this price it's good. Silicon material good to wear no feeling of like we are carrying it on our neck . Its comfortable having it around the neck due to good silicon material. As this is in ear canal type speakers we. Eed to really push it inside the canal 1st 1/3.then only we can enjoy real beats and bass. If you wear it superficially sound won't look great. So far battery , durability,sound ,price this is best one."
197,3.0,"CONS:
-These earphones does not tell remaining battery till it is very low. A button should be there to know battery life.
-After battery gets low they don't last more then 6 mins or so. Also voice assistant keeps shouting battery low. They become unusable.
-More earbuds should be there. 3 sizes do not fit all.

PROS:
- Boat has best after sales support no other company comes close to them. Repair and replacements are completely hassle free. ""THIS IS WHY I PURCHASED THESE"".
-Sound quality is good.
-Build quality is good.
-Water resistant
-Battery lasts sufficiently long ."
198,5.0,"Writing this review after using boAt 225 wireless headset and JBK t160BT...I must say that boAt has got excellent bass and sound quality compared to JBL one.
Superb sound quality and built. Very comfortable in ears. Value for Money!!!"
199,4.0,"First of all..,If you are looking for a good Bluetooth headset go for this one.The product is amazing and very pocket friendly, thanks to amazon for the discount and speedy delivery. Was Not very sure about boat headset but this one surprised me..Battery backup is awesome and also displays the battery level on the mobile phone to which is connected.Amazing bass quality and refinement in the audio clarity overall a very decent and good product. Last but not least this carries one year warranty."
200,1.0,Bass lovers .........Will love this. Boat rockerz is truly for bass lovers with wireless it's giving tremendous sound quality........ Go for it.....Giving 4 star only for delivering used headphone to me getting replacement this week...... Otherwise this is better wireless than sony and senhiser which are more costlier than this.....If don't want to spend more than just go for it. Will update as I will receive new one and tell you about build quality and looks....Also share pics. Replacement is faulty and seller is not giving me replacement of headphone again so returning the same.
201,1.0,Earphones are fine but the customer service of boat company is worse .buy at ur own risk .No help will be provided and for that i hate this product.if i cud i woudnt evn hav given 1 star.
202,1.0,I am not sure what went wrong I used for while jogging and in a week's time it is not charging. My return period has also expired yesterday 18th Feb 2019. I keep it for charging but the red light never glows and also not switching on. Regret buying this product for 2000. Advise not to buy this product very bad quality. Should have invested that 2000 in some other products. I have been a regular buyer in Amazon did not expect this type of product. Please allow me to return this product
203,3.0,Hey guys...I have purchased this Bluetooth headset 50 days back.... Boss and trouble is okay not very good as like I heard that boat is awesome brands for these all things but not getting all things good...and now I am getting some issue as like battery life and most important thing is that when I am start to using this headset then not able to hearing proper music and video....voice is coming sometime not coming...I mean Bluetooth connection is going automatic off and on....that is very big problem I am facing....I have not excepted this type of major issues on this brand....can anyone help me please
204,5.0,"See I'm writing this review after rigorously using it for 1 month. So it's my honest opinion on it. No BS.
1) Sound Quality is really very good. I personally like it. Now I don't know of others taste. While listening music it feels good as it gives balanced output.
2) Among all I'm quite impressed by it's battery life. It really goes on long after continues use I've noticed it & even quickly get charged also once put on charging mode toh anyways battery ka toh muje nhi lagta problem jaldi aane wala h.
3) I've handles it in various ways and also put it in various ways in bags sometimes thrown here and there and main thing I've use it in rain recently for really long time I was riding and suddenly rain came so at that time came to know the quality of it. It's really nice. I've used it in rain for almost 4-5 times in heavy rain although that's different thing that I later on after 10 min covered it because intentionally I don't wanted to damage it.
4) When you are riding a bike and if unfortunately you put earphones in ear which you shouldn't do it but if someone does also then the problem is that by air flow the 👂 earphones get moved away because of air from our body which sometimes make us uncomfortable while riding. So for that you need to tuck earphone's inside your tee or shirt or beneath your collar of shirt to get hold on.
5) It's a very light weight earphones don't go on my words you will feel when you take it in your hands.
The only thing they should have provided is more earphone buds of various size they didn't gave anything with box.
Overall till now I don't have any hard feelings or negative feelings toward it might be because I haven't I think experienced, that's why. Good to go with this product. 👍"
205,5.0,"The best Bluetooth headphones I have ever used. The Best in this price category.

Pros:
1. Unbelievable battery backup. I am getting 1 day battery stand by. I use in office from 9 am to 7 pm then the battery lasts throgh out the night.
2. Best fit. The earpieces will not fall out how hard you shake your head.
3. Light weight. It is so light weight you can not feel the band on your neck.
4. Stylish look.
5. Magnetic parts on the earpieces make them stick together.

Cons:
1. Sometimes you feel like the wire is lengthy.
2. There is a voice notification when calls come ""incoming call"". It would have been superb if the voice notification says the contacts names."
206,3.0,This is a good quality ear phones with durable wire. But the wire is very hard not so flexiable and big compared with other earphones. This doesn’t fit to a pocket for sure. It has a magnetic base which combines two sides when not in use. The major thing is that this ear phones once bought cannot be returned only replacement option is available in amazon which is quite disappointing
207,3.0,I purchased this headphone few months ago after 2 month i found some problems with their wire then I registered my complaint last months from their website and till now i haven’t recived any confirmation from boat side their cc not picking my call I tried from last months after that i send email aswell approx 50 time but I didn’t recived any reverts from their side.boat service is so pathetic I advise to go with any other brand as compare to BOAT
208,4.0,"I have the wireless on the ear headphones from BOAT (400 I guess...can't remember the model details) for about 2 years and still works well. I am an occasional user of that.

But I wanted something for my commute and I was looking for something wireless and with in ear buds to go with my 1+6T. I found these for 1k during the recent sale. Here are my initial impressions

1. The sound signature is very very bassy. You need to use an EQ to bring it to your liking. Try listening to a song that has a heavy beat or bass played high to experience your tolerance levels.
2. If you use a One Plus 6 or newer phone, go into the audio tuner option in settings and set the 'Sound Enhancement' option to 'One Plus Bullets Wireless's and the EQ preset to 'Pop'. This should balance out the bass and it surprisingly alleviated the mid tones.
3. Pairing was east. Long press the middle button and put your phone on blue tooth discovery mode.
5. Sweat resistance and durability is something I have to wait and watch as this is just initial days. But looking at the construction quality, I think it should be ok.
6. Call Quality - not checked. But I don't intend to use it to take too many calls anyway.

Verdict: Good for 1k but not worth more. in fact paying more than 1k and buying something for listening music falls into the audiophile category. For that, you should really invest in an established brand like Bose or Sennheiser."
209,1.0,"Exactly after a Week of Last day of Return, the Product Started malfunctioning. It Does not get switched on without plugging to a power source (Some times). Automatically, the Volume is getting reduced and Increased, Automatically the Songs getting Paused and Changed in the middle.. (No touch required at all....). Mic also Not working properly. I have checked this with Other Mobile also , and got the same results.Full time u can hear the Sound of Some one Pressing the volume Button.. Beep Beep beep.

I want to Return or Replacement. Very bad Experience."
210,3.0,"It's been a month, I'm using these earphones.
The product is good, still I would say for this price it could have been better.
It's solid & has very good sound quality.
Easy to carry & smart looking but it sometimes takes a lot of time to connect with my phone & the part of it which holds it into the ear got loose already & it got out of ear a few times.. on the charging point of view it work pretty well.. 30 mnts charging is enough more than 3-4 hours continues use. All & all it's good but a lil expensive."
211,3.0,"Purchased on 20-June-2019

BoatRockerZ wireless earphone has started giving connectivity issues since this morning. Now it often gets disconnected and after a few seconds it again connects. Sometimes I have to turn off and turn on to pair again

Initially I thought it was because the device was away from the headset and I started holding closer. After several trials, I gave up thinking that could be because I haven't put the earphone on charge last night. But after entire day of charging, when I connect to listen the same issue recurrs.

I am now looking for my abandoned wired earphone."
212,1.0,"I usually don’t write a review but felt the urge to mention the very unprofessional after sales service support so as to affect purchasing decisions.
Usually i buy a electronic product after thorough research on the specifications, product reviews, price etc. BUT WE TOO NEED TO WEIGH THE AFTER SALES SERVICE.
I had a problem of charging my earphones after 10 months of use within the stipulated warranty period of 1 year.
Next I tried their Customer Care number but there is no online or on phone registration facility of the complaint! They send a sms link to register but the link doesn’t open (see pictures)!!
Next I sought their service centre in my city Ahmedabad and found a single centre for the whole city some 10-11kms away. I reached the centre to be totally disappointed with the centre which was a small shop size with no parking. They checked and found the problem to be due to water damage to the charging point. Even though never has my earphones touched water, I accepted that and asked for the solution, but then the twist started!
They refused to repair it even on payment basis - reason that they were just there to replace the piece if it was a manufacturer defect. They genuinely were not their for any repair work.
They asked me to talk with the call centre executive to find the repair solution but the call could not be connected to the executive in spite of 20mins of waiting. I am trying to talk with the company for last 48 hours but every time the recorded voice assures me that My call is going to be connected in short time but no success.
In short I feel that I will have to ditch the 1100/- rs product for just unable to get a customer paid repair.
The thing I disliked is that in today’s smart world the boat customer website is not taking an online or telephonic complaint and you can not talk to the executive.
VERDICT: I will definitely avoid BOAT products in future in spite of attractive Branding and cheap prices due to a very lazy service system."
213,5.0,"I really loved these headphones. My intent to buy them was for the gym and they completely solve the purpose. They are light weight. Easy to use headphones. I also use them for all my calls now, it is saving me from all that radiation we take from using the smartphone on our ear. Really happy with it."
214,1.0,"item stopped working within 15 days, completely dead. charging also not showing anything, reading the other reviews its clear that there are many ppl who had faces this issue with the earphones it suddenly stops working and shows no signs."
215,1.0,"Never ever buy this at all. stooped working after 3 months both side audio not working. when approached customer care they said they will not repair it or replace it. they said it happen sometime so we don't replace for it. what the hell.... worst ""cheap Boat"" brand cant even give customer support after sales. Please no should think of buying it. rather buy sony headphones."
216,4.0,"I have researched the available wireless earphones in the market and chose this one based on the reviews and YouTube videos. I am using it for my Cell and while watching movies/programs on my Smart TV. I was unable to connect to my laptop due to Bluetooth issues on my laptop. I may have to use dangle on my laptop.

Likes -
1. Its easy to pair your devices with this earphone.
2. Sound quality is good.
3. Noise cancellation is good.
4. Light weight and stylish to use anywhere.
5. It is water resistant (Not water proof, remember). One time, I have used it in the moderate rain as well.
6. Easy to carry and not bulky. Provided magnet keeps both earbuds at one place, so it won't be a discomfort when you are walking/running/in Gym and not using the earphones.
7. Decent battery backup. I use 2 hours at a time mostly. In a day, I use it for like 3 to 4 hours and I only charge once in 2 days based on my usage. If you use more than that, then you may have to charge it everyday.
Dislikes -
1. As they advertised, I am unable to pair two devices simultaneously.
2. Its an irritation to charge as the battery pin will not fit with adapter at one go. You have to carefully insert it.
3. Unable to answer the call via ear phones. You have to answer it on the cell phone and talk via earphones. Same goes for cutting the call.
4. Initially, there was discomfort to keep the earphone in the ear for an hour itself (while walking). After that, Its ok.

My conclusion - Good one to buy."
217,3.0,"This product is average in sound and built quality. 3.5/5.
It comes up with good boat packaging and additional set of earbuds rubber in different sizes similar to other products. However 'Rockerz' branding is missing which is not big deal.

Previously i have used sony, nokia, skullcandyand JBL bluetooth headphones, so its difficult for me to lower down with boat. If you want to listen music then its good option. Little Bass is present.

Controller buttons plastic plate length is little extra compare to other headphones. LED indicator is tiny and not continously available. Additional rubber curve above earbuds are good for little additional grip.
Considering lower price in segment, this product is okay. If budget is your priority or if its your first try with Bluetooth then blindly go for this. It will not put you down.
Cheers, Ashutosh"
218,1.0,"Please don't buy this product. Only after using for 1 month earphones had stopped working and got it replaced within 15 days time. Now again I'm facing same issue with the replaced one.
Had bought this earphones for jogging especially for jogging purpose however the keys don't work and I'm not sure of these are even sweat proof. Purchased in the month of March'19 now facing a lot of issues as to charging, battery life, Bluetooth connectivity, ear placement."
219,1.0,"Damaged Product and Packaging.
Though this item was packed in another bigger carton box with air bubble cushioning and few other items, this particular item was damaged and the deal was open already.

Thought, at least the product should do well, but the product failed to take charge and power up, which clearly indicated the product was a formerly returned item due to malfunction. Rather going to manufacturer warranty and repair/retirement this got resold.
I've had many ear phones from BoAt and really love this brand (in the wireless category) alternating to House of Marley (in the wired category). But this one was shear disappointment."
220,4.0,"I love these Earphones.
My battery lasted from morning 6:40 am to 11pm where it was continuously connected to my smartphone. I used it for calls and for1 hour for music in this time period.
There's a lot of Bass. This can be levelled with your smart phone's inbuilt equalizer, but it will be a pain if you are using multiple music players or video players.
The build quality is good w.r.t. the price. I bought it for Rs. 1399/-.
Bluetooth pairing is very fast. No hazzles.
It can be used for all activities but not voice recording. So if anyone is looking out for recording audio with this device then this is not at all what you are looking for."
221,2.0,"Got these in sale and very disappointed. I had earlier JBL wireless headphones and they were of very good quality then I lost them. Saw ad of these wireless headphones in newspaper and decided to buy as I already use Boat 400 which are awesome but I got disappointed with these, I have to speak very loudly in order for my voice to reach the other party (which looks very weird in public) and I feel that quality is also not upto the mark. Amazon I feel knew about this and thats why these were on sale and non returnable.

I am now stuck with them and I DO NOT recommend that you buy these at all.

Thanks."
222,5.0,"After using around 3-4 months..
This is one of the best earphone at this price(₹999) wait for the offer.
Noise cancellation is truly awesome. I m living in a place where the wind speed reduces the speed of the vehicle, and when i was using JBL earphone then the person i was talking to get irritated due to the sound.
But this cancels all this wind sounds.
And yes bass lovers.. u can expect an average bass as compared to a precious earphones. U can adjust bass through Equalizer if u need more bass"
223,5.0,"This is a good buy. Sits comfortably around the neck, earpiece is good, and feels sturdy.

Noise cancellation is surprisingly good at this price range (during phone calls person on the other end hears very less background noise.)

Sound quality - good with Android. With iPhone the sound tends to get crackling at high volumes when equaliser is on. No complains on flat sound.

Wires are a bit long, but you get used to it after a while.

My only issue with this and other BT earphones in this price bracket is with the voice breaking. If I keep my phone in my pocket (jeans) and walk the audio starts to break and I have to reposition the neckband. This has happened quite a number of times. I used to own a Tagg inferno and MiVi thunderbeats, both had this issue and this one too.

To summarise, worth buying, if under 1500."
224,1.0,"This is disgusting. The product stopped working in exactly 12 days. Bought on 7 Mar 2019 and the return deadline was a 10-day window. This is utter nonsense. Don't know how to return this damn crap now. I'll need to file a suit rather, for the benefit of greater good.
Current update as on 26 April: I got the replacement product directly from Boats company and Amazon played no role or assisted in anyway."
225,4.0,"In this price range, its a good one.

Earlier I was in doubt that how tha mic may be ?

But the mic is so much clear, even its that clear so that the next person can even hear the background noise highly if you are not in silent place.

Sound quality is good. Battery backup can be improved. As of now the backup is okay okay.

Powering on, incoming call messages are good.

Bluetooth connectivity is also good.

Overall a very good wireless headphones with mic."
226,5.0,"Pros :
1) Excellent Battery Backup(Using it since four days on a single charge).
2) Crystal Clear Hd Sound with no audio video lag.
3) Durable flat wires.
4) Looks and Build quality is awesome with magnetic earbuds.
5) Sweat and Water Resistant.

Cons :
1) Call quality is good but Mic does not have noise cancellation so receiver receives noise.

Verdict :
Blindly go for it if calling is not your primary concern."
227,4.0,"I purchased it one month back after comparing it with so many products. But to my surprise noice cancellation , bass and sound quality of the product is just amazing. Even compared with JBL LIVE200BT which costs around 4200 , this headphone is far better than JBL one.
just go for it if you want to have a good wireless headphones in this price range.

Only Con i came across is the battery indicator is not working properly it suddenly jumps from 40 percent to low battery but actual battery life is as claimed around 6-7 hours"
228,5.0,"These are of really good built quality(premium quality) except rubber holders and provides smooth sound quality and bass(condition is to use proper ear bud) , happy with the purchase as I used some other brand such as JBL, skullcandy, house of Marley. It is standing with those brands .
The bluetooth gets connected very easily, and its almost 1 year even I accidentally damaged one side even now they are working perfectly
happy with the product

Pros:
Good built quality
Good sound & bass
Easy connectivity
Perfectly fits
Good for our door

Cons:
I found it some what uneasy while in use (might be because of gripper I never used )

*Note examples I gave for JBL and .... are for sound quality that I really consider at this point of price"
229,5.0,"This Product is Awesome... it is this much popular if you roaming around any mumbai railway station,normally commuters using earphones during traveling. Surprisingly out of 10 people 8 using BoAt Rokerz...its pretty common device.because in all aspect it is best.
Honestly I have purchase its earphone 10 days back and I am using 1.5 hrs average daily till now battery showing 30 % amazing.only one problem nowadays BoAt Rokerz earphone own everyone or prefer everyone because of Amazon 999Rs offer. Hence if you travel in a train you will find many BoAt Rokerz presents in along with you LOL"
230,4.0,"I was looking for a pair of bluetooth earphones to use during my gym workouts and I found these for Rs. 999 during a sale event. Here's my review after 1 week of using this product -
Pros:
1) Excellent bass quality. You'll love these earphones if you are a bass lover.
2) The earphones are lightweight and the magnetic tip makes it easy to carry around neck. I find them really convenient to use at the gym
3) Good noise cancellation & sweat resistant.

Cons:
Battery life - boAt claims a battery life of 6 hours but these run out much before that. It shuts down even though my phone displays 20% battery left
Ear pain - The ear buds are not the most comfortable pair you can find. My ears start hurting after prolonged usage
Mic - The voice quality is not that great and not preferred for taking calls.

Overall it's a good buy for the price range."
231,2.0,"I really rely a lot on reviews while buying stuffs. So I take efforts in writing one to help others too.
Well, I was actually blowed out by the near to lakh positive reviews of this headphone. So ordered it without 2nd thot, faced two issues,
1. Bluetooth range wasnt satisfactory and 2. Constant disturbance. I assumed that may be mine is defective as I still relied on reviews I had read. So I ordered a replacement. Sadly the replacement looked like a refurbished item with no proper seal and packing. Anyways it was the same as I felt on my 1st boat.
Additinally, I ordered sony WIC200 headphones. The experience was different. Advantage was good range of connectivity and soft sound on ears.
So to summarise, in a line for people who like bass, mostly want to use it for movies or hear music, BOAT is best in range and for people who want good call range and soft sound for music n movies may like to buy WIC200 Sony."
232,4.0,"I have already used boat earphone and was quite satisfied with the performance interms of sound and bass, however I didn't expect that much this boat rockers 255 is tremendously performing great sound, clearance, noice cancellation bass will never gonna feel you headache and all if I talk about battery it works 7 Hours a day continuesly...well fitted in ear without any pain got this deal at lightning price at 999.
Thanks Amazon to provide such deal and swift delivery and your faith!!!"
233,5.0,"I feel they are the best in the business. They have come out with exceptional quality, awesome product at the exact right price point. Awesome accoustic experience is what Boat provides and i would go so far to say that they are the Bose of their price point. I have been using Boat rockerz 250 in the past and those lasted well over 3 years while delivering exceptional music experience throughout. The battery started to give way after 2 yrs but that is expected of all these products. The 255 have better sound quality in terms of bass, accoustic, treble if compared to the 250.
The wire is a bit too long for my liking but that’s probably cause i had gotten used to the short wire of the 250.
I am sure these will again last me well over 2 years. My brother didn’t listen to me and bought noise shotz and he is regretting his decision now. Poor sound quality, battery quality, connection issues are some of the issues with the noise shotz.
Everyone should give them a try once.
I had skullcandy before and they were replaced by the company 4 times in the first year while the warranty was active and i had to throw them away after the warranty expired as the 5th piece also malfunctioned. The Boat experience though has been an awesome soundblowing experience."
234,2.0,"In terms of sound quality, it is good. But this earphone is not for sports activity. The cable is quite heavy which will not let the earphone stick to your ear on heavy physical movement.

Range is not even 5 meters. As soon as you cross thredistance you start getting interruption.

Bluetooth quality is way poor that when you are walking listening music and have put your phone on your pocket, you start getting interruption.

Wire is way to long. Around 2-3 inches extra, which looks weird if you are not putting it on and just kept it on neck. I have given the image. I am 5.4. The earphone is hanging 5 inches below my chest.

Overall, bearable for walking, but definitely not good if you want to buy this for jogging or exercise."
235,4.0,"I had ordered it because I had expected more from it. This is my second Bluetooth inear headphone (first was the old LG HBS 730, mind-blowing device). Anyways, the sound is OK - not bad but not good. Noise cancellation is good, voice call audio quality is clear to the other end, the buttons are good but can be more tactile.

My only gripe is that the music audio quality can be better. Bass should be more powerful and the mids, treble should be a bit more clear and refined.

Also, I suggest that they should add the two volume buttons + call connect/disconnect button at the left side + a vibration motor and keep the right side only for multimedia buttons (play/pause/rewind/next/previous).

But, since the price was much less in Amazon sale (below 800), it is only fair for the quality we get. I will hope they fix all this and release their next version, even the price is higher."
236,3.0,From last one week the battery has suddenly stopped working. It does not work for more than 5 mins and charge does not report above 60% when connected even after 2 hours of charging. It was perfectly fine for 2+ months with around 45 mins of continuous playback time and around 6 hours of standby time. Please replace the battery or provide new unit. I had a lot of hope from BoAt Rockers brand on long and reliable operation Thanks
237,5.0,"good product
battery life 2-3days with 1 hour of charge
sound quality is good full of bass
well fit in ear without any pain for long time use."
238,5.0,"Hi All,

I have purchased boats earphones after reading many reviews and asking to my friends who are using boats....from everywhere I got good feedback and when I personally felt good.

Meanwhile I check JBL brand aswell costing 2000 aprx with the same specifications. JBL also good one but if u r looking MORE BASS then boats bit more than JBL in this price range.

CONS:
because of rubbered ear strips...u cannot hear outside sound...coming to JBL u can hear outside sound as well...u don't feel like ur ears are completely blocked with JBL earbuds.

Concl:

Both Boats and JBL are good... U have to choose based on your Priority and interest n comfort u feel with.."
239,1.0,"Headphone is average but most important thing in todays era is after sale service on this side this brand is pathetic dont go for it at all.
I have used other headphone brands in past but never have faced such ridiculous service.
I have given my boat headphone around 2month back fr issue related to one side not working...which is usual as sometime it happens....but till now i have not got my device back yet after several mails on diffrnt customore care boat mail id. I think this brand is just focusing on selling but not on after sale service which is very crucial. Brands in todays date are so much concern on after sale service as am using other diffrnt..
So pls dnt go fr this brand...i would suggest go for any branded company which is more committed."
240,4.0,"Some disturbance always comes through speaker after hearing some message tone or some music. I don't what it is. It's kind of some electric leftover pulse discharged a some kind of sound through the speaker.

Also when ever I cut the call, automatically music starts. Where I never played a music before the call.

Rest is fine. Bluetooth connectivity is good. If we receive a call in one mobile and cut , it automatically switches to other mobile if any call is waiting there. That I really loved."
241,5.0,"Great headset for music lovers. Solid bass, loud volumes and volume control separate for the headset in addition to mobile volume control which is a huge plus. Good sound quality on audio calls. Did not try while jogging, so unabl to review the moisture wicking properties much. Good length to the earphone cable and good battery life. I purchased it for 949 INR and h nice good VFM. Overall I would buy again.
Design wise, I like the Boult wireless better than this as the wire tends to hang long down your neck when you are not using the earphones Otherwise a great product to buy!"
242,3.0,"At Rs.1499, there are few areas that boAt delivers and largely others where it doesn't. Noise cancellation and bass are it's highlights while you might have to compromise with the poor build quality, sub-par sound clarity and battery life.
With 1 week's experience and daily usage I have come to find:
1. The battery doesn't support more than 3-4 hours of playtime, even at 70% volume.
2. Great bass which might sometimes overshadow the mid and high tones.
3. One of the earbuds has stopped working for which I have ordered a replacement and will post an update on the same.
@Amazon/Appario: Excellent all-round experience from order placement to delivery to replacement initiation."
243,1.0,"I would like to say , the quality is good cor the price but one side stops working after 1 or 2 months.
Thats not an issue because its under warranty.
BUT heres why u should NOT buy this product.
No service at all. You try calling the service center and you just dont connect.
I registered a complaint 15 days back and literally no response.
I have 8 products of boat because i thought its value for money but with no after service whats the point."
244,5.0,"Pros: excellent sound production even though it's bluetooth; I've stopped using panasonic wired earphones because this product produces better sounds. The mic is positioned perfectly and the other person can hear well. Bass is very good indeed, I connected it to TV and the movie sounds were mind blowing, felt like a movie theater. Battery back up is really impressive and lasts a whole day for me, it depends on how you use it though. Charging time is another pro because it gets fully charged in an hour even when connected to laptop. The chance of losing these are minimal thanks to magnets on both earphones which attach themselves when not in use.

Cons: the band gives me allergy because of constant rubbing with the back part of my neck (this is just my issue as I suffer from skin related allergies). The lights on the earphone are too dim. The bands on the earphone which give it a unique style are hurtful, so I removed them totally and also changed the ear buds to red (used panasonic buds) . If you are a fast walker like me and when not in use, the earphone will swing like a pendulum, so I put it in my front pocket or shirt (this is not a con really).

Conclusion: absolutely great earphones and bluetooth is perfect 👌 don't waste your time looking for other options unless you have high expectations with bass and other features."
245,2.0,I had purchased after seeing so many positive reviews but there is nothing extraordinary. Battery drains after 60% like one minute it is 60% and it goes off after max 2-3 minutes. It does not auto connect even after paring. Have to manually connect every time. Also the sound quality is not at par with JBL. Now that I have put in 1500/- have no option but to continue as long as it works.. which does not seem very far along.
246,1.0,"After 15 days of research I ordered this product. I got the neon one. The band is flexible and lightweight. I mostly use this while I go for cycling, on the first day, I just kept my mobile in the front basket of the cycle I was not able to hear any sound from the earphone. Later I moved my phone somewhat near to me then I'm able to hear songs. This is the first thing which I didn't like. Second thing was there is no noise cancellation, very poor noise cancellation. People on the other end of the call are able to hear everything from the background. They are not able to hear my voice properly, background noise was so clear that they disconnected my call telling that they're getting headache. After this incident I immediately returned the product. Usually I don't write reviews for anything, whether it's good or bad. But if I don't write many users will buy the product unknowingly. So do not go for this product. It is not good in any way. Leave about bass and all. There's is no noise cancellation and poor connectivity issues."
247,5.0,"Quality's: It's a best Bluetooth headphones i used, excellent bass quality, best quality loud ness, nice build quality and awesome product.
Battery life comes easily 2days of medium use... Good battery life
Rating: bass 4.7/5, sound loudness 4.8/5, sound quality when hight and low volume 4.6/5, Bluetooth design 4.2/5 ( cable length is little bit long ), water proof 4.5/5 ( i am used this headphones in small rain & not problem i noticed)
And final thing is you can trust the brand ""boAt rockerz"""
248,3.0,"For listening to music it’s very good. In fact Awesome.
For making calls its not worth it as People will keep on complaining that they are hearing all surrounding noises better then your voice. May be because of bad location of mic or poor quality of mic.
Noise cancellation is just a myth. It doesn’t happen in this neckband. Infact other person will hear more noises than your voice. But still at ₹999/- its good... at least you are able to listen to music perfectly."
249,5.0,"It is best deal @ 899, I don't think other brand would provide same quality in this range. I can feel the clear sound in the every play. I have tested the call quality and I can sy it superb. I am bit worry with the charging, there is no indicator for the charging. It is a nice one. The earphone bud are good and comfortable. It pairs the mobile so fast. There is bit concern in Bluetooth range. I guess this could be more coverage to function."
250,1.0,"Stopped working in 3 months.
Claimed warranty but it takes forever..still haven’t received the replacement as well as no email or SMS or call from Boat.

Don’t buy these earphones...spent a little extra and buy Sony or JBL at least their products a good and if any issues they treat their customers better and resolve the issue quickly.

I already bought another Bluetooth earphones and I guess I’m gonna wait for 7-8 months for Boat to replace their faulty product."
251,4.0,"No doubt about the product. The quality of music and it's bass will never disappoint you. The only thing that is extremely disappointing is it's Bluetooth connectivity, So it comes with Bluetooth 4.2. You can never enjoy music in an open area where it's airy, Cuz that creates hell lot of disturbances while listening to music, I have used Bluetooth 4.2 earphones before this is the worst experience I ever had, The audio stops for more than 3 seconds if it's really windy. And it keeps on interrupting. You can only have a great experience when you're in a room. Plugging in the earphones and riding a bike is your worst decision (first of all it's not safe, 2nd of all, You can't hear a thing of the music or a voice in a call). So I suggest people to go for Bluetooth 5.0 only! If you want seamless experience. I'm not sure boAt has any device that has Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity."
252,3.0,"I got this earphone on a Prime Day Sale for 999 INR only. Such a great bargain.
So I have been using this for over a month now and this is what I have to say:
Pros:
1. Price. Get it on a Prime Day Sale or wait for it to go on a Lightning Deal.
2. Great Noise Cancellation. I have used it in various environment staring from overcrowded bus to setting beside loud sound and the noise cancellation has never failed. It blocks almost 90% of the incoming surrounding noise which is a great plus point.
3. Great battery life. 16+ hours of listening.
4. Quite high volume.
5. Great form factor and the magnets to hold the earphones together is quite strong.
6. Boat provides various ear-cups of different sizes.
7. One tap Google assistant.
8. The wireless range is no doubt great.

Cons:
1. Terrible bass. My 350 INR Boat wired earphones have better bass than this one.
2. Volume could have been a bit higher.
3. Not the greatest sounding earphones. Opt for a wired one if wireless is not a necessity.

Conclusion:
If you are on a tight budget and looking for a wireless earphone, then this might be it for you but if you want a great sounding earphone with nice bass, then look for other options. Boat is a company which you can trust. They also have a great customer support. Props for that."
253,5.0,"This a great wireless Earphones and the green color looks really cool. The quality of sound and bass is also satisfactory at this price range. It's worth the price. The charging speed is little bit slow I feel. And with continuous use it can work for like 7 - 8 hours. I felt if the battery life could have been better like if extra 2-3 hours was there then it would have been great. And one issue I found was with the battery indicator for this earphone, it's not that reliable. In just 5 mins the battery indicator which shows 20% suddenly drop to 0%. They could have improved the indicator and made it more reliable and efficient. Otherwise it's a great product."
254,4.0,"I bought it for Rs. 899 and at this price range, I don't think I'll see a better alternative.

Sound quality is a solid 4 out of 5. The sounds are nice and clean. The bass has a distinct punch to it. The noise cancellation is also great.

The Bluetooth connects almost instantly and its range is about 25 feet on average (with walls and obstacles in between).

The battery life is great too. It lasts almost am entire day with intermittent use.

If you are getting this for under 1000 rupees, go ahead. I highly recommend buying this."
255,5.0,"decent battery life
i am not into heavy bass and awsome sound clarity so i dont care much about music quality. but i can say that one can live the music quality but if you are music buff and looking for some high end earphones like bose or beats or high-end sony in your mind, this is definitely not for you.
mic works well
bt connectivity is good and pairs parallelly with multiple devices
better than ear buds as these earphone works with helmet and body is also of good quality
i feel comfortable to wear these while workout with the exception of running.
while running you should put this inside shirt to avoid the neckpiece from jumping and create annoyance but i never had issue of ear buds coming out of ear during workout

but sometimes i feel battery life could have been even better"
256,4.0,"So I bought this earphone with some suspicions in mind. Wasn’t very sure that it will work ok. I have used it for a week now and here is my review:

Mic quality for calls : Good, if the mic is on your neck, near your mouth, the quality is good. Have received feedback from friends who were on the other end of call.

Audio: Audio is quite good, bass is alright, the level you can expect at this cost.

Comfort: Comfortable to wear, the earbuds fit perfectly, just the little rubber thing sometimes doesn’t fit in my ears (guess it is meant for bigger ears)

Connectivity: Range is about 5-6ft, not more. Sorry to say this but I have faced this issue with all bluetooth headphones. So I guess either you buy more expensive or stay within this distance of your phone/laptop.

Battey: Battery life is surprisingly good. I use it all day with one time full charging. About 6-7 hours."
257,4.0,"This wireless Bluetooth stereo headset is of decent quality for its size
High frequency sound is reproduced fairly transparently
Mid ranges are decent too
Low end bass is a bit boomy for my liking

At first look, the piece is well made and seems durable. Only time and usage shall tell.

Do note that the neck band, while being flexible can't be rolled like a wire. So don't buy one of the round cases with the hope of fitting the headset into it."
258,1.0,"Absolutely poor quality sound, very low volume, lousy bass. I would have even ignored the sound but for the fact that the earphones just don't fit properly. Even with all the options given. These are only suitable for walking at a leisurely pace for those who are on a very tight budget. NOT recommended for running or jogging as the earbuds will keep popping out. I returned the originals once thinking I had a defective piece but the replacement too had the same issue. Spend a little more and buy something better."
259,5.0,"On time delivery and product is good.. the bass wasn't feeling great initially but after changing the in-ear buds with the bigger ones provided in the packing the sound was significantly better with better bass and treble. Easily connected to my mobile phone, Smart TV, and laptop. I got it on 26th October, today is 30th.. I have not had to charge it at all so far.. i use it for a couple of hours everyday.. so battery life also seems decent.

It's good value for money. Would surely recommend."
260,3.0,"After using of 7 days I am sharing my experience build quality is good
Battery back is good almost 8 hrs long after one charged
The wire looks weird in your neck the length of the wire is too long it seams touching to near by your navel
Magnetic part is work prety well but in only 7 days the logo of Boat is getting fade
Sound quality is good but not up to the mark
While driving the 2 wheeler wearing this headphones the disturbance while listening the music online experienced couple of times may be due to lack of connectivity of Bluetooth
Most bad thing about this device is it captured surrounding sound very quickly/easily better than your voice during on call ppl compleining what's going on near by you so my main purpose of purchasing this is not solved thoroughly as I want noise cancellation during call but it totally failed I purchased in 999 bucks"
261,3.0,"The headphone is great, but it loses track in between and then behaves wierd.
I usually use it to watch movies and sometimes it loses track and the voice breaks. Also delay keeps getting added to the signal. Have to disconnect it form laptop or mobile and then restart the earphone. Upon reconnection after restart it behaves fine for some time, but again the same thing keeps happening.
Hope the manufacturer does something for it.
It lasts decently long once charged.
Sometimes my ears pain after using it for 3-4 hours."
262,1.0,"This is worst product fullfilled by Amazon. I got defective item or all the items are same. Noise cancellation not at all working. Battery drains from 60% to 20% in just 30 to 40 minutes. After that every minute it irritate battery low audio message. Earbuds are very hard.

From last three days i am waiting for pick up. Worst experience from Amazon. Don't buy anything on Amazon Prime days. If they can't provide delivery on time in normal days then how can they do in peek time."
263,4.0,"This product is definitely one of the best in its range
It has the best bass quality in its range , comes with a year warranty although after some use you may find its sound a bit less , otherwise no issue and easy repair/replace by the company for malfunctioning product saying this with experience bcoz the first ones delivered to me started malfunctioning after some use but after filling a complaint with the company it was resolved they replaced my unit with another one but took like a moth in the process which to some extent is considerable as it was a door to door service"
264,5.0,"Sound quality: 4.0/5

Noise Cancellation: 4.5/5

Battery: 4.0/5
Lasted usually between 7-9hrs
Charging time 1 hr 45 min approx

Bluetooth connectivity: 4.0/5
10 meter tested both for laptop and mobile.
However i faced problem of getting connected n disconnected repeatedly in few occasions when usually battery is below 40% even though my phone was next to me."
265,4.0,"I am using it from last two months.(Rs. 999)

Sound Quality_ Moderate (difficult to listen music in hevat traffic)
Noice cancellation _ Not upto the mark
Bluetooth connectivity _ Excellent
Range_ good
Charging time is less and has sufficient battery backup ( say 1 day)
Conical buds causing pain innear so I removed them.
Wires are quite long.

Gud to play PugG🤪"
266,4.0,"After using this for almost a month, here is my review:
Best things: Amazing battery backup (almost 6-7 hours), very good noise cancellation, comfortable, easy to use, proper size
Could have been better things: The quality of sound could have been slightly better, I don't have any other complains.
Absolutely go for it, best option in this price range. You will not find any other in this range that is this good."
267,4.0,"<Pros>
* Rich bass
* Good built quality
* Magnetic lock
* Nice grip over neck
*Good company service (had to replace it because of faulty charging)

<Cons/>
*Dont leave the charging cap open because sweat can get in through it and damage the charging...

*Detailed review*
Boat Rockerz 255 bluetooth in-ear headset is a very good quality product. It has a very rich bass and nooce cancellation is also pretty good. Accessories like ear buds of different sizes and charging cable are provided. If you workout and sweat alot then make sure to keep tha charging cap closed because if sweat goes through it then it may damage the charging, the charging stopped working after 2 weeks so i had to replace it..and the company service was amazing it took around 10 days and then i got a replaced piece back with extra accessories..

*Conclusion*
I would really recomend this, this headset provide a very good value for money.
PS- Just dont walk while using it..because the noice cancellation will not let u hear anything else and it may cause an accident.."
268,5.0,"Got this deal Amazon Great Indian Sale
It's a worthful deal at the price of Rs.899
Battery life is around 5 to 7 hrs (not sure of the maximum limit)
Good connectivity
Bass is little higher
Wire is little long but its best used for sports activities...difficult to hide device inside the shirt
Google assistant works fine
I doubt the durability of the wire

In short, best for the budget sports headset at low cost( Just wait for the deal and buy for 889 then if its not working after 7-9 months just replace it with another deal) just my opinion for low budget headset"
269,5.0,I can't get enough of this earphones.. Sound qulity is so clear in highs and lows.. Battery life is more than expected from a bluetooth earphone.. It is showing more than 1 day battery life. And the quality of the material used is so nice... I am happier than expected.. And thank you amazon for fast delivery.
270,1.0,"I was quite satisfied with the product till the time there was no fault in it, once the fault occurred in left earpiece within 6 months (Still in warranty period) then it's almost impossible to use the warranty as you will never be able to connect to boAt customer service, If you call their customer service they keep you waiting forever, the email id provided is invalid and their customer support is only available between 12pm-6pm and so far Amazon customer care has also not been able to resolve this.

Even if the product is good but now i regret purchasing such product whose service centers are very limited, which makes them reachable through phone or email only which they never attend or they provide invalid email id."
271,3.0,"I am writing this review after using this Cellphone over a week usage , I bought this t diwali sale for 999/- colour: Neon
*] Battey backup will not come not more than 3-Hours.!!! DISAPPOINTED!!!!
*] Bluetooth connectivity is bit poor, while talking voice , it breaks, person in the call will complaint your voice is not clear
*] As said bluetooth range is not more than 10Meter
*] Good sound Quality Earphones quality is good with strong magnetic lock, Comfortable on ear
NOTE: boAT earphone ,difference between With wire and Wireless, With wire earphone Sound quality is awesome..!!!!!"
272,2.0,"The problem is its battery life.. worst
I had boat rockerz 270 which worked so well once charged.. also.. it has a very abrupt behaviour when discharged..

I had kept it on charging for good 3 hours and when turned on.. it started saying battery low in 5 mins .. then switched off.
I put it on a car usb charger for 15 mins hardly n it said 100%.

The sound quality is just ok... Not sure of its real or fake coz its just like any other local earphone brand.

You will start feeling headache / ear ache if you are using it for long time.

Also the charger provided with the product is cheap, low quality and the wire is very small in length.
The 2 magnets are not quite working..

Only good things about the earphone:
Lightweight and good color.
The earbuds are fine as they fit in and do not get off easily, in case you go on a running or something while these are on."
273,1.0,Everything going well but today sound not coming from left side i don3 know why right ear aide working fine but left side sount too much slow which irritating me now.
274,5.0,"This earphone is a good product in this price range and it's running good. Although some minor issues I have felt in this product and one of them is convenience. There is a knotch above the earbud which is helpful to fit the earplug in the ear, but some people may have different structure of ear and for them it will not for well eg. one of my friend.
Another issue was there; just after reaching the battery level to 20% it starts disturbing telling low battery, and within a few minutes it turned off, I think boat should think about this.
Otherwise I'm using this product for couple of months, till now its running well and the sound quality is also good."
275,4.0,"I bought this bluetooth after reading many reviews online

pros:
1. O mahn the bass is really good being a bluetooth device
2. in ear fit is good
3. battery life is decent, I never used it continuously for more than 1 hr or so
4. you can pair it with your PC & mobile at the same time, basically you can pair it with two devices at the same time

cons:
1. the wire seems a bit odd then you wear it, its just too long according to my liking, I mean it should be similar to **Boult Audio ProBass Curve Neckband in-Ear Wireless Earphones**
2. ear piece is a bit bigger in size

3."
276,4.0,"Eventhough it connects two divices at the same time, however audio doesn't switch to the first device connected. While playing the audio from the first device connected, it doesn't work. Only it works for last device connected. We need to reconnect the previous device to get it works.
Not sure manufacturing defect or functionality limitation. Atleast it works flawlessly for other bluetooth headset like Jabra.

ANyway it's light weight and sound quality is better than many other product of same price range"
277,5.0,"This is my second purchase of Boat Rockerz 255. The earlier one is being used by my wife. I went to Reliance Digital to purchase some other headphone. I almost finalized on some other product when i got demo of this product. It was way better than what i had planned to buy. To differentiate i listen to the 3D Barber shop video on YouTube. On comparison, this definitely got more points. This is one product i always advocate for. Using it for three month, will post long use review after a year of use. Wires from the unit to ear could have been short though."
278,4.0,"Good 1 @ Rs.910. I bought it during sell.
Sound clearity is awsome.
Bass quality is awsome. Fits ears well.
Bluetooth connectivity is good upto 10 feet distance
Perfectly balances low & high frequency below ~85℅ sound intensity
At higher sound level, high frequency bits are noisy & disgusting. But you can eliminate this issue if you adjust equilizers.
Satisfied purchase"
279,4.0,"The product design is really good, comfortable, lightweight. The color combination is perfect for the unisex collection. I picked a red and black combination. The noise cancellation for the call is good but not up to the mark. The biggest drawback I felt was I could not connect to my laptop via Bluetooth plus you cannot take calls from the headset. the buttons are to control the volume and play and pause the call."
280,4.0,"I got it fo rs.900+ in offer. Worth the money. Quality was okay for 900 but actual cost was 2000+ so for 2000rs its not up to mark. Sound quality was amazing. It cancel noise for some extent. In this price cant expct 100% so 5 star from ma side. Bluetooth connectivity s working fine so far. Can connect 2 device at once. So if u listn song frm any bluetooth device n u get cal from ua phone , u can recieve right away. Overall satufied by it."
281,5.0,"This is best when your phone has dolby atmos or Dolby effect . 5 stars for that.
if you have no such audio effects , in normal mode the sound quality is above average.
Especially BASS. Bass quality is excellent when Dolby on. (Motorola !! )
As all the headphones review will be biased because most peple dont understand that their headphones alone wont help in quality of sound output"
282,4.0,"Pros :
- Battery Backup is awesome
- The sound quality is good (Not too heavy or too light, feels good)
- Light Weight (Expected from Bluetooth Headphones)

Cons :
- Bluetooth connectivity takes variable time. Sometimes it connects as soon as it is ON. Other times, it takes a couple of minutes
- The multi device connect is gimmicky and not very seamless. I got it to work with a mac and an iPhone
- Mic is not very sensitive and may not be suitable for speaking while traveling"
283,4.0,"These some of the most worthy BT Headphones in its price.

Pros:
1. Good Bass
2. Flexible
3. Easy to Connect and Control
4. Decent Battery Life (6-8 hours)

Cons:
1. Loose Ear Grip
2. A bit too Lightweight
3. Flimsy
4. Doesn't have any indciation for battery life"
284,4.0,"got it for 999 in prime deal day
Good sound output
battery lasts about 5 hours at a stretch
sound quality good for music - okayish for calls
The ear grip does not let this fall off even while on treadmill/ jogging
not heavy on the neck
buttons are easy to operate
once paired to your phone - connects instantly the next time you switch it on
bluetooth range- two average room size
Green Black is a better vibrant colour , then plain black or red black"
285,5.0,"This is some awesome sports earphones a true sports gear. I've tried a number of sports earphones and they all fell flat-faced with the kind of sweat I get during workouts and I had to return or dump them later but this one withstood all i gave and still going great.
Sound quality is okay but good for a wireless headset of this price range, doesn't matter for me as I use it for sports activity only."
286,4.0,"I wasnt expecting the world after reading the reviews, but these seem to work pretty well for the basic purposes. Noise cancellation, as expected is average. Bass is slightly low for my liking but over all sound quality isnt bad at all, especially given the price. I would say, for a pair of everyday earphones, these are definitely a good choice. I have been using them for a week or so, shall update review in a month if need be."
287,4.0,"I have been using boAt wireless headphones since two years they have never disappointed me.
This is my 3rs boat wireless headphones but i must say this one impressed me alot according to the price segment (Rs 999),it's doing a perfect job of delivering good quality of sound.
Regarding the battery life its is 6hrs, but its quite Ok since i have purchased it for 999rs only i can't expect much from it.
Coming to sound quality it has a bit more bass, the bass is more than treble but not a problem for those who love high bass.
Overall sound quality is more than good in this price segment.
The build quality is not that high quality but yes it is sturdy enough to withstand normal drops.
Acording to me the length of cord is too lengthy.
One thing i dint like about boaAt is connectivity range, the range of connectivity for this is less than 10m,but again budget matters. Given a thought i had paid only 999rs,i am very much satisfied with overall performance

Regarding service center, the customers leaving in Mumbai has added advantage as i had.
My previous boat rockerz 275 one earpieces suddenly stopped so i visited the service center in Goregaon and they replaced my headphones with new in just 5 minutes without any questions asked.
So customers in Mumbai don't worry about the warranty."
288,2.0,"The product has great looks but it is disappointing on the audio quality considering how good the headphones of the same company sounds..
Also even after returning I haven't yet received my refund amount even though it says my refund has been issued.
I have kept quite for all this time thinking there might have been a delay in payment but there's no update after I got an update saying your refund has been issued."
289,5.0,"This is a very good product and very useful
1)Sound quality is very good
2) noise cancellation works very good
3) the two pair of extra ear plugs provided are also of very good quality
4) the rubber hook which is there to provide better stability helps while doing rigorous workout
5) quality of the flat cable and the buttons is very good one can buy it without having a second thought"
290,5.0,Got this one for 899₹ during great indian festival...for this price it is really a good headphone. The build quality is good...the main attraction is its bass...bass is really good...overall the sound quality is good....also there is no issue with bluetooth connection...battery backup is fine. Worthy purchase under 1000...This is the best bluetooth headphone you can get around 1000 rupees...go for it...
291,3.0,"my ear is goes out of order ,i am placing on line complaint but does not go through,pls replace it or suggest me what to do . this time i am in pune(Maharashtra) and my contact mobile no is 9811917164,

will give all star rating only after getting feed back from the co."
292,5.0,"This is my 2nd blue-tooth, the sound quality is proportional to the money you pay. Battery back up is really good I used the old one more 10 months and the battery (7-8hrs) performance was still as good as a brand new headset. Now its been 2 months I am using this am happy with the performance. Must buy this product for GYM.
Noise cancellation quality is also really good.
Can connect 2 device at a time is the best thing. I so connect to my laptop as well as mobile phone this feature really saves time and handy usage."
293,2.0,"I researched a lot basis reviews and finall brought them at rs 1000 in republic day sale.
Coming straight to review, drop a like if it helps.
Cons
-------

1) biggest con is huss sound or buzz sound at low volume. It is so annoying. I am quite surprised why reviewers have not said anything about this.
If you want to listen to songs or calls at low volume. This is not the best, ready to get bothered by consistent hissing sound.

2)if you like to run or jog while listening to songs, this one is definitely not for you, since the movement of band will cause lot of noise disturbance while running and will annoy you. Its ok if you want to just sit and listen.
3)
I don't find the fitting very comfortable, it seem claustrophobic to be. Ears started to pain after 30 minutes or so. Boat needs to work on design of earpiece to make it more comfortable.

4)sound quality is not as Supreme as marketed in reviews etc. The lows are very poor. Bass comes to effect after mid ranges. Overall not a very soothing experience in terms of listening.

Pros
------

Build quality is good.
Wires look string and premium and buttons looks of good quality plastic.
2)bluetooth range is good, no issues encountered while moving from one room to another.
3)there is a battery symbol displayed on phone, so you get to know the charge level.

Overall summary
For me the first con of huss and buzz sound is enough to not recommend you to go for it, I have not tried any other bluetooth headset so can't say which one is best.
GO ahead for if you can bear with the same and only listen to music at very high volume."
294,1.0,"The worest Bluetooth earphones...if you put mobile in front pants pocket it will not properly connect...if you put in back pocket it will not connect at all...it will only connect if you hold mobile in your hands...what a damm worest product...
If you want to buy frustration and anger for 899/- then go for this... probably the worest product from boAt..
Appreciate then in decreasing the happyness index in India with the help of Amazon...

Only buy this is you want frustration, anger and irritation for next 6 months...but show that on boAt earphones not on your mobile..."
295,5.0,"Super quality bluetooth earphone.
Simply u can say premium quality earphone in economical price .sound quality is amazing. Bluetooth connectivity is automatic ..

Packaging was super

If this is available at 999 or 899 then go for it.. Worth of money.sound qualities is fantastic Premium quality earphone in economicals price.battery backup is too good. 5-6 hr always
""sound quality"" awesome"
296,5.0,Simply amazing. The sound is just brilliant and if you can get it for 1000 bucks then even better. Beat is very punchy. The bass is held together very well. Mid tones and table are perfect as well. No issues with Bluetooth connectivity. Battery backup is great. I haven't used it at a stretch but I feel it should run for 6 - 7 hours on full charge. If you use it while jogging it does hold but not the most comfortable. They can fall off your ear while jogging.
297,1.0,"First of all,, This review is about Boat Rockerz 255 Bluetooth earphone. Generally , I don't have the habit of writing product reviews but this s*** earphones made me review this in order to save the other consumers who are planning to buy this CRAP. In my opinion ,,Firstly , An earphone should be comfortable to wear. In this regard,, it makes you to cry in pain even after 5 minutes of usage !! Secondly , it should have a good audio Quality !! It's just okayish when it comes to sound quality, Nothing great to talk about it. Overall, Never buy this earphone even if they give it for free unless if you wanna hurt your ears with this abysmal earphones."
298,1.0,"I have ordered many products from AMAZON but this time a wrong selection for a Product from BOAT
i mean to say about Boat Rockers 255 sports edition .
Got the product today by 1 pm (11Nov) tried for switching on ,but its not powering on, thought battery low for new product ,so kept for charging for 1.5 hrs tried to switch on again its not powering on..
while connecting to charger its showing bluelight (its means its fully charged), but while removing charger its not powering on.So its clear fact its a defective product. returned the product on the spot to Amazon .

Very bad product , i was going through reviews found many of them has faced issue with this product
i don't why this kind of product amazon has kept as best seller and Amazon choice product.
Kindly remove this product from Amazon choice their are other best products than Boat.

Thanks"
299,4.0,"Boat is awesome if you like to hear bass's and quality.
I am using one plus 6 and quite satisfied with boat. In case of audio controls
Double tap + button to increase volume & single tap for change next track.
Double tap - button to decrease volume & single tap to previous track.
Double tap o or middle button to dial last call, single tap 2 seconds for Google assistant, single tap immediate to play or pause music, single tap long press to on or off boat rocker or Bluetooth connectivity.
If u charge daily 20 minutes it's enough for long day continues music.
Overall Good product."
300,3.0,nice but btry backup is not so good
301,3.0,"Pro
On comparing to other wireless earphone among the same price range, this one is the best in every aspect. Voice quality is good and bass is also good.
BUT

The con is -
1. Its range is very less. Maybe 1 or 2 meter. Thats the lowest quality Bluetooth range exist.
If you move 2 meter away from phone then the earphone is useless.
2. Noise cancellation is very bad."
302,1.0,"While hearing songs it was stuck often...there was problem in bluetooth..whenever try change songs or increase volume though boat device, songs getting stuck,there was some disturbance..so i returned it..amazon replaced to me another device but that too doesn't work.. Tried to put charging for more than 2hrs but battery remains 10percent, not increasing morethan that... It was working only when connected with charger..if plugged off, stopped working... Had bad experience..please try to change the dealer..."
303,5.0,Head phone is really nice to use.. Writing a review after using it for a week.. Sound quality is good. Very easy to use.. Call quality is also nice. I'm using it for taking long calls and listening music.. It fulfil the purpose. Battery life is good and easy to charge.. This product is good for those who look for good blue tooth headset with decent cost. No cons as such.. Even the ear bud n model is good to use..
304,2.0,"I bought it to use during my workouts in the gym. And it fails miserably if you are doing exercises with lots of jumping and movement. It falls off very easily. Also, the most irritating feature is if the battery is low it will continuously start poking, battery low message and you can't use it. The build quality is also very mediocre but that's fine with 1000 bucks pricing."
305,1.0,"It has been 3 months that I have bought this product, it was working fine and suddenly just stopped working..as per the warranty mentioned on Amazon, it was showing one year warranty...I had called customer care and they had told me they will get back to me the next day but there was no help.....infact it was an Amazon choice recommended product....I called the customer care and Naresh who was attending my call told me that Amazon won't be able to help.....such a bad experience... would not recommend to buy this product....I thought Amazon values are linked with Customer first....but looking at the way they deal would not recommend others to buy the Boat headphones..... Overall a bad experience...."
306,4.0,"Best wireless in the low budget.
Sound quality is great,very clear sound.
Bass is great like woofers.
Slim and comfortable.
2 days battery in daily use.
6 hours actual time continue playback songs.
Connectivity is only 10 Metres.
Connect 2 users at a time.
Talking on call is not much better.
Use earbuds for comfortablity."
307,4.0,"Review for this product is always positive as the product itself is amazing.
Bass is very much exceptional as we can expect it from any of the Boat accessories.
Audio quality is Good.
It gives 6 to 7 hours of battery life on continuous music play or movie time. While gaming it gives approximately 10 hours of battery life, I personally tested it.
But one cannot put it on ears for a very long time. Ears start aching a little after 3 hrs of uninterrupted usage.
Connectively is very good. Sometimes it gives normal glitches but still there is no need to bother about it.
My overall experience is Highly Satisfactory and worth buying it!
I Recommend to buy it without any hesitation. Very good product at this price range."
308,3.0,"Everything is very good about this product. Great sound, I love it. However, if I I hadn't lost those ear plugs and their hooks that help u stick them in ur ear I would have given it a 5 star. They gave extra ear plugs but not those hooks that hold on to the crevices of ur ear to help u enjoy the bass. I can't find them separately on Amazon either. It would be great if Boat could include those in the package."
309,1.0,"I had my boat rockerz 255 picked up on 11th September for replacement as one side was not working properly Since then I have got no revert from the boat's team, these guys are not picking up there calls on customer care number and are giving no response over the email from 20-25 days. My Ticket id is 538530.
It's been a pathetic experience with the boat as these guys clearly don't value there customers and are running there business like ""Gupta Jee's"" Shop. They are only hungry for your money and as you can see they don't provide any real support on their social media pages as well."
310,3.0,It's a good product in itself with good audio etc. The issue for me is that I was looking for something that is good to run with and unfortunately the part that goes over your neck just jumps up and down when you run and it's quite annoying. This product is better suited for walkers. Even though sound is good I will buy another product instead which doesn't have the stiff heavy neck part but is just a cable.
311,4.0,For the price it is offered I would recommend this . Noise cancellation is surprisingly good . Sound quality is also impressive but not the greatest for sure . Bass effect is more . Fit the ear perfectly and doesn't come off . Wire and exteriors are made of plastic but serves the primary purpose . Bluetooth slightly deteriorates when you keep the phone and move to another room with too many walls obstructing . But overall is a good deal . Battery lasts upto 6 hours .
312,4.0,"I personally have a problem with headphones as none of them would fit into my ear during running and workout.
But trust me this one is the best as it has better sound quality and doesn’t slip off.
Got this one during festive season at 999rs.
It has descent battery backup as well.
My marathon run has become more enjoyable now.
Thanks Team Boat.. 👍🏼"
313,5.0,"I got this earPhone at Rs 999 during the sale, this is my first Bluetooth ear and overall experience is great.

Build quality is superb, lightweight, sturdy and stylish.
Sound quality is great but not as good as Skullcandy, JBL, etc but again in this price, it's awesome.
Connectivity is super quick, just turn on and it's connected. BT range is not that great, it can be improved.
From the battery side, it takes about an hour to juice up for 0%-100% and last for a day(at volume Level 50%-60%).
Things that I didn't like is wires are longer than it needs to be, as I already mention BT range is not that great, mic catches to much noise(no noise cancellation)."
314,4.0,"I have been using now since over a month and i found corns in the product its not mine its over all of same model i checked with other too they also noticed the same

1 . Noise cancellation is really bad ( its good that you can hear background noise with whom you are talking but sometimes its really annoying )

2 . Battery indicator over the phone once phone is connected . It shows 100% initially then after using for few hours it will shows 80% then all of a sudden dead RED

3 . Connectivity sometimes i noticed it get auto disconnected and manually i have to connect it back .

Quality is really nice , Battery life could be better ,"
315,4.0,"Connectivity: seamless, connected well with iPhone
sound quality: surprisingly well balanced bass
Fit: really good, and can be used comfortably well during workout
volume: since its in-ear, not reco for high volumes, due to its tight sitting, NC works quite well
VFM: fro 999, worth the cost, and is quite inexpensive compared to other BT sets"
316,4.0,"You know its only good for music not for games and anyone who want to buy first check the size of your ear because mine was unstable and was falling down again and again ... In fact , I returned my earphone and instead bought boAt Rokerz 400 headphones that is better as, for music is amazing and wireless and in gaming foot sounds and so on are amazing and you can either choose wireless or wired (cable given with headphones)that is why it's make more adorable... I prefer choose wired headphones or earphones for gaming..."
317,3.0,"Before bought this read most of reviews it mentions as Immersive Sound but this will be a better choice having a more balanced sound

1.genuine sound vocals very clear
2.High bass
3.Less treble
4. Average build quality
Compared with my previous Sennheiser CX 275 this one less quality only.

if your in very tight budget if you want to purchase Bluetooth neckband go for this otherwise dont buy."
318,5.0,"I am writing this review after using it for now 9months. Had no intention to write as I believed it to be a normal good buy. The product since the beginning was perfectly working and was of worth the money I spend according to my budget. I am a constant user of headphones and hence in normal conditions both the earplugs got stopped working recently. With the help of my amazon bill details I requested the company for replacement, trust me I got the best service and got it replaced within time. I really felt nice that the supplier kept their promise of warranty and hence I would surely recommend this supplier for buying new things from them. Thank you Boat rockers, u guys are very very genuine and efficient."
319,4.0,"This is a good bluetooth headset for its process, sound quality is great and I recommend this for Bass lovers!

Bluetooth coverage is pretty good but average!

The only thing that that I hate in this is the LENGTH, when I put them it comes till below my chest, irritating while washing face etc
Samsung Level U design is much more greater!

Only that, apart for that this is a great one!
I got it for Rs 999/- in Amazon Summer Sale early as I’m a prime member"
320,1.0,"The product is decent, however certain flaws.

1. This item is not a right fit for apple devices. Whenever there is a volume increase or decrease in apple mac or iPhone or ipad, it gives buzz sound.

2. It often disconnects from the devices and reconnect.
3.it often started giving welcome note without even i am disconnecting the device.
4. Does not connect to 2 devices at a time.
5. Very long cable in the front and often goes down to your tummy if you are moderate person in size.

If you are good to invest couple more bucks, you can get either realme or mulo bluetooth earphones which are better than this."
321,3.0,"I also own a Bose premium headphones which I think I cannot wear everyday to gym, so I bought this product for my day to day workouts. Comparing it with Bose, sound is not that crisp but for a Bluetooth earphone under 2k it worth it. I really like the beats and sound is pretty awesome too.
Full marks for that, but I find it pretty annoying while working out in gym. There is a U shaped clip at the end of which two wires are attached which connects to earphones. The sturdy clip has to hang round your neck all the time. If you are running, the clip might start rotating and that would slowly force one of the earbud come of your ear. Pretty annoying...believe me, you have to turn the clip time and again to hang it around your neck in correct position. Also, while doing ab crunches it will keep on falling back and take both the earbuds along with it.
I was mislead with the pictures, I thought it is all wire and no clip but its not. Just wanted to point this out so you dont make the same mistake ;)

But if you are not into too much workout and want it for travel, then connection range and awesome beats is great deal.
Cheers."
322,3.0,"I brought this one, after using boAt Nirvanaa Uno. Uno had good quality stereo with nice bass. This is sounds like a mono headset. I think bass is too much or not set correctly. It sounds differently on Mobile and PC. I am not satisfied with the sound output. It connects to both PC and Mobile same time, so attending mobile call and Skype call with no hassle. For Rs. 1990 there are better quality available. I trusted boAt based on my previous purchase with UNO."
323,4.0,Got this for 1399 during lighting sale.. it is worth for what u paid.. don't expect toooooo much performance.. it is value for money that's it.. yesterday afternoon I have received this product. That time battery was 100%. It is always connected with my phone.. after using of nearly 12 hours (only connected with phone. I am not using for audio & video purpose. Approximately I have used 2 hours for audio and video purpose) now it's battery is 60%.. it is okay product
324,1.0,Not good as I thought. Writing this review after using 3months. Noise cancellation is not good. I purchased two headset of boat rockers 255. One of those set partially stopped working. Called amazon customer service. Waiting for replacement.
325,4.0,Boat Rockers : Mainly concentrated on heavy bass in equalizer bas mode is excellent. But other modes are just like normal headphone sound. Battery back up excellent i mean on full volume [100%] exactly gives 6hours music playback. And normal very low 30-40% volume gives playback upto 9-10hours. Disadvantages of all Bluetooth device is need to charge every day we don't have enough time to charge our cellphone these days who else will plug both device and Bluetooth headset at a time for charging. Please go for wired headphones.
326,1.0,"It is very good for listening to music and podcasts and provides good sound quality. If you are travelling on a two wheeler, the mobile has to be kept on your side pockets or your shirt pocket. If you keep it in your back pocket, the sound will keep breaking.
The earphones are however absolutely horrible for phonecalls and just not built for that purpose. 60-70% of the time, either you cannot hear the other party or they won't be able to hear you."
327,1.0,"Worst product I haver seen
Multiple try than it will connect

I does not support dual devices

Noice cancellation is ok to the extent

Range of this product too much low

I buy this product because of name
Now I regret why I purchase this product
If you ask they can replace
I already replaced and they send this worst product as there is one time warranty they take advantage of this send worst product

I buy this product without discount means rs1500
Now one can understand how bad product is it
Not RS. 999
Better to purchase product worth RS 350

I regret but I can't do anything other than this"
328,5.0,"Wow!these Bluetooth earphones are just best in price, sound, Desgin and everything...just close your eyes and buy it❤️the sound quality of these earphones are damn high you will be blown with it ..."
329,1.0,"I'm writing this review 6 months after using the product. All of a sudden lots of issues have started, battery dies after 15 mins usage, can't make calls via the device. Registered a complaint in their website and the product was picked up by courier since it is in warranty, its been more than a week now, no update from the company. The customer care number provided is always unanswered. Don't waste your money on Boat devices."
330,2.0,"- Replacement product covers with full of sand and dirt around it, i think it directly shipped from sahara or cairo😁
- Not feel special about this product as audio quality is normal, battery even discharge in 4-5 hrs of continuos usuage with normal sound, I'm really very upset with this purchase.
- Voice is not audiuble clearly to other, many times while on call due this alrady replaced it twice but still not satisfied with that.
- Below Average product if you looking something good try other product.
- Other great products are available with same price or little higher with better features and quality."
331,5.0,I am using this product from last 6 months and happy with its overall performance. Bluetooth connectivity is good connects faster to both Apple phones and android phones .Battery lasts for 5-7 hours depending upon how much calls and music you hear so at this price it’s a good product to go for . Noise clarity is good but it’s average for noise cancellation. Would recommend to go for it .
332,4.0,"So the battery is comparitivley good, the fit is very bad. It hurts your ears. I did not feel great while taking it outdoors but it can survive basic running and jumping. The audio is good for the price. Got it on a deal. 999 is worth spending if just want some cheap yet sturdy headphones. And the paint wears of after some time, easily scratchable."
333,5.0,"I've been using this headset for the past 7-8 months and the following is my review.

Pros:
durable,
feels premium,
good bluetooth connectivity,
fair stereo quality,
bass is acceptable,
stylish,
magnetic attachment looks cool

Cons:
battery life ~ 3 hrs on continuous usage,
mild uncomfortable after putting on for 1-2 hours,
earhooks doesn't fit properly - always come out,
noise cancellation is just ok.
microphone doesn't catch sound properly while on call"
334,1.0,"Everyone please read before buy
Ii used this Earphone 3 weeks then i write review.

Quality - earphones quality is good..but when you wearing your neck getting irritating after some time...and very long wires..of earphone..

Charging - charging time 2hrs for full.charge..
And back alos if you using continue 2 hrs only backup time...

So please don't buy this earphone...
Don't go for this ear phone..

Better opstion available in any brand like jbl/ sony."
335,1.0,If u think of some bad product's I've got. This is one of the top ones. Got the new one which died a week after the return date passed. Sent it for repair and got the replacement after 4 weeks which worked for less than a week. Sent it back again and got it after 4 weeks which worked a little more this time and lasted for 3-4 weeks and the battery is gone again. The battery doesn't last for more than 30 min no matter what I do. Charged it for a few mins and hours and neither made a difference
336,1.0,"1) Sound Quality
Sound quality is very bad their no bass it looks like a copy product of boat Samsungs wired handsfree are much batter than this handfrees.

2) Not suitable for gyming purposes the handfree is only good when you are sitting at one place and using handfree.If you are not stable ate one place hanfree will come out from ears again and again.

3) worst customer support from Amazon they are making customers fool by giving 10 days return policy after purchasing the product you can not replace or return your product they only show that you can return your product under 10 days but actually you can not."
337,1.0,No problem with design and noise cancellation but it lasted only for 45 days. The right side is stopped working. I have observed that boat product don't last long even though there quality of sound is good. It's a complete loss for me. I should have buy jbl.
338,5.0,"Got the products (ordered 2 black , & neon) today for 999. Amazing product as the name suggest. Good deep bass,but if you want to improve sound quality of earphones adjust the equilizer of phone. After that just listen to amazing sound. If anyone can answer my this question. Why ocean blue color is expensive than rest of the color. As this blue color is price 1400 and rest 999 why so."
339,1.0,M very very disappointed with this product. I bought this product on 2nd Oct during sale period for my brother to gift him today on bhai duj.. and when I gifted him tHis today they are not working so complete waste of money even now m not able to return them as window is closed on 10th Oct ... seriously just don't buy them it's wastage of money and spoil your surprise too ..so embarrassing for me when my brother tried to use them but they did not start..spoil my surprise too
340,4.0,"I bought this product in sale, so got it in very affordable prices.
my first impression towards the wireless earphones are not so good, as it comes with some constraints in which battery issue is one of the major.
but after purchasing this product my perception is completely change, this earphone has a very nice battery backup, I have used this earphones since last couple of months but still I have not facing any issue for use this product. also has a very nice build and durable quality.
I recommend to all who wants to buy wireless earphone in affordable price."
341,3.0,"This is my third purchase for the same head set I was fully satisfied till I bought the realme Bluetooth headsets
There are better headphones with better features available in the same price range or
Rs 300- Rs 400 extra , You get the realme Bluetooth headsets which is way better than Boat Rockers .
Trust me it like upgrading from Maruti to BMW"
342,4.0,"I bought it for 899 rs during Amazon Big Billion Sale. Amazon delivered it on time. I am writing this review after one week of usage.

*Pros*
1. It's light weight and easy to use.
2. It can be paired with your phone very easily.
3. Sound quality is punchy and it has decent noise cancellation too.
4. Call quality over this earphones are great and no one complained from the other end.
5. It's cheaper than most other competitors at this quality range.
6. It is great to use without the protruding rubber ear petal holder. So, remove it and use.
7. The battery with stood almost for 4-5 hours average.

*Cons*
1. The battery percentage option of the Bluetooth earphones on your phone might show 100% for some time and it may jump to 80% after a while. It can't be trustworthy, because it may suddenly jump to 20% and may turn off immediately. So, never trust this battery percentage option.
2. It has a decent range of Bluetooth connectivity, if you move 5 feet away, you may experience sudden dip in the quality of music or call and the clarity deteriorate.
3. The ideal charging Ampere is not mentioned in the user manual. People may tend to use high Ampere chargers and ruin the battery.
4. ""People also bought together"" suggestion for a pouch along with this earphones is misleading. I bought that zip pouch and you can't keep this earphones inside that small pouch. Because, the neckband of this earphones can't be rolled or curled or bent.

*Final Verdict*
Go for it, to experience a decent pair of Bluetooth earphones at this cheaper price point."
343,4.0,"Very Nice product in the price range.

344,1.0,"Its been 4 months. It worked fine, but now there is some problem on left side ear phone. Cant hear anything from there.

Customer Number Provided is Also Fake. Trying to on that from 19th Apr till today cant reach anyone.

Now how do i request for change of headphone??"
345,4.0,Bought this @999. It can connect multiple devices at a time. Sound quality is good enough at this price. Build quality is very good. Bluetooth connectivity and battery life is impressive. You can use it for hours without any issue. It comes with different sizes of buds. I would strongly recommend if you are looking for something reliable for daily use.
346,5.0,"Yes !! Quality is there....
I was concerned about the sound but it is way up to the expectations... Treble is a bit low (marginally low) but the Bass n overall sound quality is been exellent... Happy with the battery backup as well... Charge once n use for straight 6-7 hours at high Volume...."
347,3.0,"This is my 2nd boat rockerz 255. The one which i used before had a little bit more clear sound in terms of mids and lows, it was a tat louder aswell. The 2nd One which i purchased 2 weeks ago seems having the same model number but the quality has definately been downgraded, the branding on back of the earpiece has also got washed out in 2 weeks. I beleive this has been purposely done by boat as there is a high demand of this earphone and they are selling it at their lowest price ie 999 during the sales.
The people who had the old make and has the new make aswell will definately understand what i am saying. When connected to bluetooth the old one said ""you r now connected to boat rockerz 255"" however the new one says ""you r now connected to boat rockerz"" this is one of the difference aswell.
Boat will loose customers faith if the downgrade their product and sell it with the same name."
348,4.0,"Mid range is poor. The finer sounds are not extracted.

The product is extremely light and u won't feel it's there. This is an awesome feel. Sooper bass and crystal clear pitch. Bluetooth connectivity is remarkable. I received it yesterday and played for 3. 5 hours without and drop in performance. Seems sturdy. Yes, while listening to audio from Gaana, was getting a 3D feel, as if am sitting midst of a concert."
349,1.0,"Review after 4 months of usage.
Life of this product is of 3-4 months,its not durable or reliable.
One side becomes non-functional.
The after service is the worst from Boat.
There is no service center and there is no one to respond on calls
You may log a ticket with boat but there won't be any resolution for a month and no one will respond to your query.
If you don't get frustrated with above things and are ready to pay more than 1000 bucks for this.. then God Bless U"
350,4.0,"Sound quality is good. Bass is wonderful. Better life is awesome. There is no connecting issues. Before order I am very much doubtful about the performance of this earfone, because of reading some reviews in Amazon. But when I used this, I am very much satisfied. Amazon shipping is always good and prompt."
351,1.0,"Purchased two Earphones, out of which one works good, however the second one has very bad battery storage (Drains out within 1 hr play, secondly the Blue tooth quality is not good, gets disconnected frequently from mobile phones. I would to better go for an better quality(expensive) earphone."
352,5.0,"Fast delivery by Amazon. Just 2 days. Item received just today.

First impression is soo well and i feel its worth the amount i paid for this item. The bass is good. It fits in the ears properly.
Only i found a very little negativity is that the length of the cable. It just pops out of my shirt/Tshirt, feels little uncomfortable. Else everything is perfect with this product. 4.5/5"
353,1.0,"Bought 3 and giving review after 5 months. Sound quality. Battery backup is really good. But the product quality is not at all good. And the worst part is that during warranty period, service by them. Worst service. It takes more than a month for a replacement to get. So what will happen is that 6 months it will be with you and 6 months with them. It is cheap, but you will start regretting it, when first time, it stops working, then waiting period will start and will never end"
354,3.0,"I bought this product after checking out so many rating and reviews. i bought it around three month ago and with passage of time, it's sound quality, working hours and connectivity is degrading.
I don't know how does it happen, in my office there is a disturbing noise during connection and it connects perfectly as soon as I move out of that place, funny it is. Anyway, if you are looking for really good product, i must say you need to increase your budget. i can't blame brand as i have wired earphones of same brand and those are perfectly working, but i am disappointed with this model."
355,3.0,"Better to invest sone more and get realme buds or from jbl. No noise cancellation or sound isolation.sound quality is moderate you can only use it indoor , in traffic or in public it doesn't isolate properly. Bluetooth connectivity is not good at all it disconnect within 10m range, and most annoying this is the battery backup, it take too long to charge and Max runtime is of 3hr at max"
356,1.0,"worst of product weast of money, i have purchased this hear phones 5 months back now both the speakers not working. i had raised the ticket for the same but no use.. several times i am trying to reach out custumer support not answered.
Finally i realised that purchasing this kind of products weast of money and time spending to order this."
357,2.0,"There r sooo many reviews saying tht this is a good product,highly recommended,etc .But the reality is tht this is an 'AVERAGED QUALITY' product. There r many other companies tht provide much better quality than this. Mine earphones stopped functioning in less than 3 months of usage! And yes it has one year warranty and all but the CUSTOMER SERVICE IS HORRIBLE! It will take almost a month to replace the product(or more if u dont bug them by calling them everyday!!!). I didn't expect this BoAt & I'm very disappointed."
358,4.0,"This earphone looks really good. But sound quality is just average. Bass is heavy but sound is not punchy n crispy. If sound quality is your priority and you have experienced some good quality earphones then you will feel that something is missing in it.In this case don't go for it.
If you are an average user who wants a decent sound and a good looking bluetoth earphone then go for it. Buit quality also seems nice.Noise cancellation and ear grip has no issues at all. Average battery back up. But it charges quickly. Bluetooth range is also decent.
Overall a decent product in it's price segment."
359,3.0,"I have been using this headset for 4 months, here is my review:
Sound quality - Excellent
Noice cancelation - Good
Comfortable - Ear bud not comfortable as it creates pain in ear.
Connectivity - Bad (Beginning it was ok but in long usage am facing too much of connectivity problems.
Battery backup: Good.
Bluetooth Distance: For Short distance it is good like around 7-8 meters

Overall comment: Need to improve in connectivity issues and ear bud model. Ear bud can be adjustable but disconnect problem has to be focused."
360,2.0,"The product is quite nice - the earphones fit nicely and snugly in your ear, the music quality is decent, the noise cancellation is also good..

But disturbance on call is a bother - I've had to disconnect Bluetooth and take the call through the phone several times because the static and noise it added to the caller on the other side. And disconnecting Bluetooth improved the call quality markedly. But this in itself isn't the bad thing - i could live with it

It stopped charging in 3 months - and no amount of trying has gotten it to charge.. Don't know what to do with the unit now that it is just sitting there as a piece of dud electronic..

Overall, buy if you will use for a short term and moderate quality is acceptable!"
361,5.0,"Best bluetooth headfones in the price range. i bought it under lightning deal @ 999/- However, I would have even paid the full MRP for this one. Everything namely connectivity, sound quality, noice cancellation, built quality, sweat resistance, responsiveness to the buttons, etc.. is awesome about these headphones. You cannot have the same qualities in any other brand in this price range."
362,1.0,"Hi all,
I got a product with defect... The problem i experience is... When ever you going to start or stop playing some audio... You will hear some fussy sound like ssssssss... for 2 seconds.. after that only audio will start or stop playing... this sound comes even before the notification tone...
i never experienced like this in any of the Bluetooth earphones... I saw few positive and negative reviews before buying... I was convinced, beacuse of the price...
And other factors i didn't like in this earphones is
1) the wire is very uneasy to use... The neck part is semi flexible and post that wire length is too much lengthy even for a guy with very lengthy neck...
2) the ear piece is not at all comfortable.. it keeps popping out...
3) i didn't feel i am using a boat earphones... It looks bit cheap... Of course the price is less"
363,4.0,"I bought this after searching many Bluetooth wireless earphones.
Here is my review after using this product for one week with my OnePlus 6T.
Pros
-Battery life is good compared to other earphones.
-Bass is good
-Light weight even u can't feel it's around your neck
-Noice cancellation is awesome
Cons
-Faced some issues in connectivity when mobile is in my trouser pockets(When holding mobile in hand,no issues at all)
-Running with mobile in trousers also shows some interruption in hearing
-Sometimes I hear unwanted noice (I think there is compatibility issues with OnePlus 6T and other devices too)
-Battery charge is always showing 100% in 6T
-Bass is good but I feel too noisy
-The voice on connection and disconnection is weird

If you are looking for wireless earphones under 1500,it is the best among the all! You can't get all the best features in this price range. So go for it!"
364,4.0,Sound quality is great in this price range. Built in plastuic. Looks a little fragile but does the job in Rs. 999. You need to take a little care of them. Fitting in ear is a little problem in initial days but your ears will adjust with it. Bass is above average which is rare in bluetooth earphones.
365,3.0,"I have bought it 4-5 days ago and i am not happy with this. there are few point noticeable .
1) Audio Quality - is Good but not very nice as it have over Bass. so you cant feel the song. you need to adjust the levels.
2) Fitting - cause it is light and not flexible this wont stay at your neck. i can drop very easily if you are riding bike or running. also the earbud are very big in size.
3) Charging/Battery - i did charged it more then one time for now as its new so i am not sure how long it is gonna work. but i feel that the charging port is only working with its cable only (as it has universal charging port so it should charge with any mobile charger also)

overall good but expensive according to its quality."
366,5.0,"One of the best boAt earphones. I have been using boAt for two years and I found their services to be very very impressive. The audio quality is very good. The music feels amazing. Bass is also good compared to other boAt products.
However, one problem is that there is latency in audio while you are playing a game. I played PUBG using these earphones and there was a mismatch between audio and the action performed in the game. If you are a gaming freak and plays a lot of game such as PUBG, Asphalt, COD, or any other game where audio is everything then don't buy bluetooth devices. Go for wired one, they will perform far better. Hope you will find this review helpful!"
367,5.0,"Best headphones I have ever bought and I have tested quite a lot of them from a lot different brands n price range.. this one simply knocks all of them out of the field in terms of sound quality, bass, loudness and battery life.. Go for it without any hesitation and you won't regret your decision!
And ya they stay in your ear n create a sound isolation too... Good for running too!"
368,1.0,"I wnated to rate it zero but the interface don't have that option. Worst product I have purchased. I have replaced the product bec it stopped working and the same problem with the replaced unit. And still the product has not completed 1year. Worst noise cancellation. If you ask the other person on the call what they hear is only external sounds and that to very clearly.

If you call boat customer care they tell ticket id is not valid. What the hell!
You won't be able to contact the customer care executive"
369,3.0,"Everything is good, sound quality is awesome, look wise also decent but.....But battery life is bad, if you consider it for using a whole day battery may end up just before your day ends. Backup of 6-7 hours is not enough for a whole day use. If you want something with good battery life jabra elite 25e is what you are looking for but something with good sound quality this is what you are looking for but if you want both this thing in one, then sorry there is no such thing available i have searched and watched each and every earphones review but this technology seems to be failing you can even see that very few wireless mouse and keyboard have good ratings."
370,2.0,"I did not have any special expectations for the headset and it was simply that. An average headset for an affordable price. There is nothing special to write home about.

Cons:
1. The irritating ringing tone that blasts your ear when someone calls. I feel like pulling it off my ear and just chucking it somewhere.
2. The battery level indicator is not linear. It stays at 80% most of the time and when you are in the middle of a call, it says battery low and goes off within 5 minutes.
3. After six months, the right ear bud stopped working. I guess the replacement warranty was for six months.

All in all, I would not recommend this."
371,2.0,"Sound is good and battery battery backup is good but there are Many features missing which will make it a very good earphones
1. Switching between calls and music is poor have to pick your phone all the time to choose option
2. mic very poor quality it’s only useful when Surroundings are very calm
3. Low battery alert comes just 3-5 minutes before full draining which is not advised for daily commuters
4.forget about shortcut keys
5. Bluetooth connectivity is good but range not good"
372,4.0,"Pros
-Decent sound quality
-good bass
-sufficient battery life

Summary
Overall a decent product under 1000 rupees
Sound quality is better than ant audio wave 702 wired earphone"
373,4.0,"Good product in this price range. Using since 1 day. Let's see if it's durable.
Sound quality is definitely good. I'm using synthesizer headphones which are counted as one of the best, compared to them, i actually liked these ones at this price range.
Definitely go for it.

After one month of usage, the audio breaks every few minutes and it's annoying."

375,1.0,"I cannot give a genuine feedback on sound quality, noise cancellation and all , because , I order this for 1399 , and I received a package with additional buds , a USB connector and catalogues. This package did not have an earphone in it . So disappointing . I don't know if it's with the seller or manufacturer, it is so strange to see an empty package from Amazon"
376,3.0,"Its got good bass. but it range for treble or Mid range is lacking.
If You are audiophile.. You will notice it's lacking. Just one day into use.
Did some tests... Yes, it lacks in higher frequencies.
However with equalizer it helps a bit.
Built wise good.. And will last long"
377,2.0,"Sound quality is good for music only... battery : working only for 2:00-2:30 hours max
Mic: very bad everyone complaining that your voice is not coming proper.
when you're doing video calling voice is not in sync..its come bit letter 1-2 seconds..and same thing happen when you sre playing game..PUBG😀😀 . I am returning this.

Product is not as per expectations..."
378,4.0,"The earphones are sleek and not bulky around the neck. Give a really good sporty look. The sound quality is very nice and not harsh. Good bass and treble balance even when on full volume.
Got this product during the Amazon sale on headphones. had ordered two earphone, one was defective; hence one less star in the overall review. The other one was in great condition. a good deal for the price."
379,5.0,"Value for money . I bought it for 999₹ in lightening deal.
Bass is fantastic feels like home theatre sound.
Sound quality as expected, was looking for something to atleast reach my iphones earphones .. and this is exact what I wanted.
Noise cancellation is superb.
Light weight. Look wise Porsche, rich look.
Easy access. Siri to working with this hps.
Ear bud magnet it very nice.
In love with this product , planning to order 1 more for my sister."
380,2.0,"I expected this product to be excellent. Two of my colleagues use the same model and have good things to say about it. So when I saw this product on a great discounted price I bought it at once.
But unfortunately my experience was no where as good. It started well. Sound quality was okay for me as I am not an audiophile. But mic failed in 5 days.
Raised a replacement request. Received one in less than 48 hours. Great. But this one didn't even run for 2 days. It started with a Bluetooth connection troube with my phone. Connected finally after charging for some time and then few restart of the earphone. Then the next day it started disconnecting and shutting down automatically. When I switch it on again, it's at 100% battery. And the next day, it refused to start at all. Had to return the product.
Thanks to Amazon for handling the return well. May be it was just my bad luck. But I won't recommend this to anyone."
381,5.0,"Awesome sound quality this product is really fantastic if you want to buy bluetooth headset under 2000 rupees this is the best option I would suggest really enjoy listening music through this Bluetooth headset and voice quality is awesome during calling good battery backup and prices also usually.
Thank you so much boat and thank you so much for reading my review."
382,4.0,Economic is what I would say. Not great nor too bad. It's decent with performance and battery life. You can surely go for it if u not a music freak and need sound quality of high standards. A really good product for day to day use. I would say for this price - the justice has been done.
383,3.0,"I have been using it since last 5months , recently it has got some problems. Some times not getting charge, sudden discharge and key buttons not working. I am not happy with this product. It has got 1 year warranty, but helpline phones not working and website also not working properly. Any one advise me in this regard."
384,1.0,"Bought it after several good reviews about the product. I don't understand the hype at all.
1) Too uncomfortable. Never stays in the ear and the earpluges are big (even the smallest in the size).
2) I started getting headache after multiple use. I could hardly use it for few minutes.
3) Can't use for call and the quality is too low. Had bought this for conference calls and every time I had to change to normal earphones.
4) The wire hangs from ear looks funny."
385,2.0,"Overall the experience was sort of okayish till first 3 months. After that one side of the earphone started having problem. Sound is very uneven. One side the volume is high and the other side, volume is quite low compared to first side. This just spoils the mood. Also there is a great lag in sound. This might be due to Bluetooth again."
386,3.0,"I read many good and bad reviews for this product and I brought it now I will review it honestly for who all are reading this review
1.My product box is fully damage and reworked the box it's like some one used it but the product is fine.
2.The sound clarity is good only for music with extraordinary bass in it but not for movie and YouTube videos.
3.Noise cancellation is not good at all it's waste I still here background noise
4.Not a great fit for workout session because due to sweat it's run out of ear and the magnetic lock is not locking perfectly when we unplugged in ear
5.its has a good battery life like there said solidly 5:30-6 hrs and it's charge time is 1:30hrs
That's it everything I about this earphones."
387,5.0,"If you are planning to take this piece then you are making a correct decision.
(Every one has different opinion about electronics because first, they've huge expectations and second, every body gets different piece delivered and unfortunately sometimes technical issues can happen and it's natural. So if any issue you can always exchange it.
Anyways, following is my feedback that can be of your help while buying this product.)

Since I've purchased it, I've come across only positive things. No complaints.

1. Sound quality: amazing
2. Battery life: sufficient. 5-6 hours at a stretch
3. Bluetooth connectivity : within seconds.
4. Calling : I've faced no lagging. Smooth.
5. Noice cancellation : yes, little parcial. In short if anybody is talking about you in front of you, you won't be able to hear them unless you lower the volume or remove the ear piece.😅
6. Value for money : definitely. I can only say, it's like you're getting a car in price of a bike.

Good battery backup, doesn't stop working, product quality is good, price range is so affordable, this particular model is good, designed lightweight, worth the money invested.

PS. It's not been too long that I've used this product, but as time passes, I'd review it again."
388,4.0,"After 6 month use, I can say this is best Bluetooth head phone in 1500 rupee.
Likes:
- Good battery life. On descriptions it had written 8 hours but I'm getting 1.5 day battery life in a single charge.
- Sound it good and extreme bass. 5* for bass
- Built quality is very good. light weight and handy.
Dislikes:
- sometimes it disconnect and reconnect automatically
- ear buds are not holding my ear perfectly and some time it's slip down."
389,2.0,"I've been using it on runs for the last month and haven't had any issues. Lately however, the earphones have stopped charging, the LED doesn't work and the earphones heat up substantially when I try to charge it.
I have tried to register the product and a complaint on the vendor's website but always receive an error. I've tried calling them but the always receive a 'network busy' error. I have emailed them and awaiting a reply.
Overall a really good product but if one can't get the product to work during the warranty period, there's no point in buying it."
390,5.0,"Been using this since about a month now,
First of all Kudos to Amazon for super fast delivery.
Earphones are definately one of the best in price range
1. Battery :- about 5-6 hours of continuous use on a single charge, pretty good battery life
2. Connectivity :- I'd say around 10-15 ft, works best with newer ones with newer version of Bluetooth, my Redmi Note 4 loses connectivity faster than my brother's poco F1
3. comfort :-. Not so great but bearable, occasionally noticable discomfort and ear becomes Sweat Dam on longer use
4. Sound :- Pretty much balance and great output . Not too much bass,not too much treble just appropriate for daily use
5. Calls :- mic is pretty good and you don't have to scream so that person on other end can hear, just need to speak a little louder than on earpiece, would've loved it if this was improved.

Overall, a great deal

Cons :-
1.Super fluctuations in price :- I bought these on prime day deal but the price other times is fluctuating fast, best would be to but when around 1200/- odd . If budget is 1500 might as well but mi sports wireless earphones .
2. Could've improved on comfort.
3. If you break the support rubber ,there's no replacement"
391,2.0,The product was okay for 3 months before the Bluetooth stopped working properly. It would get disconnected automatically. Sent the product for replacement but bOAT customer care doesn't answer calls or emails. It has been a month now and I haven't heard from them despite repeated calls and mails. The product is not very durable and you can't count on the warranty.
392,3.0,"'Rockerz' is known for BASS but it is overpowering on other frequencies. Instrumental is muffled.
But most of listeners enjoy due to heavy BASS. Noise cancellation is 100% completely block external noise.
Eartips are good (not best). Bluetooth ver 4.1 , so works on all latest phones. Bluetooth range is average. No prb. in connectivity."

394,1.0,"Sound quality is great and good bass, but disappointed with product design. Volume up/down tone is played whenever there is a change in audio stream. Example while scrolling Facebook and Instagram videos page, Volume up/down tone is played each time before start of the video. This is very irritating, looks like product design fault. I have observed this on my iPhone 6+, not sure about Android behavior.

Note: this is behavior observed after device volume control is used."
395,5.0,"The price is great for the quantity of sound it offers at Rs1000. Ok , good , great are my rankings.
Great - Price
Great - Sound
Good - Battery
Good - Bass
Great - Flexibility
Great - Product quality
Only 2 complains .
I hve to charge battery every day (max 5 hour continuous use)
My left ear sound is getting low thats an issue that bothered about. Evn my friend faced the same issue that one side of his headphone stoped working(5 months of use for freand & 1 month for me ) . And that an quality issue . I hope i will get replacement under warranty. And mind it no physical damage or water damage.
But at that price point its worth it .
And imp thing the light turns frm red to blue when fully charged ."
396,1.0,"I heard that these headphones are good and so I went to buy these, but I won't recommend these to anyone, after I used these for a month.
The sound quality is not up to mark and the main thing is the pitch changes automatically even when phone is locked.
Noise cancellation is good but by other aspects, these headphones are not worth money."
397,1.0,"Rubbish , money waste, no noise cancellation, i purchased it keeping in mind abt so many positive reviews... i was so sure abt getting it but after a week or so, it started giving trouble.. 200rs mi earplugs are far faaaar better thn this. I wasted my money, you dont do it!! Dont go by the reviews, i am shocked how it got too many p+ reviews"
398,3.0,"Does the work for portable music listening. Needs a quiet place for the mic to work, it isnt great and I never use it for calls. Base is quite high and pains your ear after and hour of listening. If you get this around 1000 bucks, take it for a portable experience otherwise invest on a good wired in-ear Sennheiser which u get below 1500 and gives the best audio output"
399,3.0,"Decent earphones taking into consideration price(900 rs) and sound quality. Low Bluetooth range .
Sometimes Static sounds comes when nothing is being played or when bing connected,which is very irritating.
Also there should be some extra weight on center so that it balance between both ears and neck.
Hopefully they would improve ."
400,4.0,"Good build quality at this price range. Sound quality is good but a little improvement will be appreciated. No battery indicatiin. No full charge indication. No option to change the male notificatiin voice to female notification voice. Glitches are too often. Battery level indication in connected phone is wrong, shows 100% and 80% then direct 20% 4 to 5 minutes before shutting down."
401,4.0,"Pros: I got this one for 999 INR as a prime day deal. The sound clarity and bass is nice. Fits perfectly in the ear. Can't get any better one at this price. Connectivity is okay and working perfectly while talking too.

Cons: Long wire (which may not be a problem for many).

I would recommend this to my friends. Hope this review helps."
402,3.0,"Pros:
1. Design
2. Build
3. Tactile buttons easily perceived by touch

Cons:
1. Medium bass which sounds not natural
2. BT connectivity range is not more than 3 meters. After that it goes on-off-on-off (breaks & reconnects)
3. Audio quality is not very great

If you are a bass lover, I would recommend Portronics Harmonics at same price but at less design quality."
403,1.0,"I made a mistake buying this item. It hardly gives 2 hours for a promised upto 6hrs. That is just half of it. Once full charged I checked it, but after two hours battery is dead. The sound quality is average, built quality is decent but the battery is too bad. I am thinking of replacing a new one."
404,5.0,I got this product in 999/ and the sound quality is very good with crystal clear vocals with great bass.The battery life is 8-9 hours in single charge and the charging time is very less it’s took 30-40 min to full charge.according to me it’s value of money under 1k nd thanks amazon for this great product in very less price.
405,1.0,I dont lik that Bluetooth connectivity of this product its easily lost the connectivity with in 5 to 6 meter even company claim that 10 meter of connectivity and microphone not good opponent Cannot hear voice properly they telling u need to talk loudly even m loudly yelling opponent can hear voice very low amount rather than normal phone talking microphone is worst otherwise may be this product has problems i want original product with proper replacement and dont want defective product again
406,2.0,When we Purchased it in April'2019. Used it for Two months now.....initially the bluetooth convenience in connecting two phone and sound quality made us happy......... but just in two months the volume has become very low... the sound quality has deteriorated ..... so we are not satisfied . will not suggest anyone else to go for this product.
407,5.0,"Nice product using for listening music and also for calls.
Good sound quality, before this i used many Bluetooth earphones but this is best.
Good sound and bass when playing music.
During call both side happy. receive good quality sound , mic quality is also good , caller can listen a very low sound also.
Battery backup is awesome."
408,3.0,This earphones are recommended when they are available under Rs999. They dont stay in my ear when i go running as the weight of the band pulls it down. I recommend Boat 261 or Chkokko M2. If you want to use it while walking or office then it's good and does the job. Microphone quality is decent and performs normally in silent enviroments however won't cancel much noise when you're in a crowded place
409,1.0,Not upto the mark. I thought it is one of the best product. But sound quality is average. Battery dies in just 4 to 6 hours. Getting pain in my ears as I wear this while watching movies or listening music. I thought there was some problem with the product I got first so I had to replace this item. But the product I got this earphone second time then I realised it's not just one item but the whole model is bad. In just 1 month it's gone. Not charging and cannot switch on the product.I would rate just 0 star.
410,4.0,"Good product. Decent sound, but Little too much of bass that it reduces the brightness of the high frequencies.
Wish it sat flush in your ear but has quite a bit sticking out but that's ok.
Battery life is good.
Easy setup and access with the controls on the side"
411,5.0,"As usual, products from Amazon and associated teams are always perfect.

Same thing is applicable for this product, on time, durable, quality checked, got at less cost as ordered during Festival deals.

Thanks to Amazon team, delivery team and all other associates

Happy And Prosperous Dipavali !"
412,4.0,"Thanks to Amazon for timely delivery!
I am writing this review after 3 days usage, Sound quality is good,not very loud,good Bluetooth connectivity and comfortable to ears for long usage. But battery backup of this headphone disappoints.I have used this in mild rain also and it works perfectly fine. Heavy bass lovers may not like this, otherwise within Rs.1000/- with a one year replacement warranty it is a good option."
413,4.0,"I am the first time boat user. Compared to jbl bass is better but the clarity and voice punch is not that great. Giving full volume bass is ok but the sound turned to become distored and noisy, not that great experience in high volume. According to the price from other headphones it is value for money but the price is very high without offer but with offer it becomes value for money."
414,5.0,"It is a great product for the price. Bass effect is good making the music more enjoyable. Voice clarity for phone calls gets a tick. It may not been great if you are using when riding, but manageable at lower speeds. I have used this during my bike rides. The ear buds sit firmly in ear and I haven't faced any issue. There are three sizes in the pack, so you can choose the ideal size. The voice command works fine as well"
415,4.0,"Good quality for the price. Haven't used while doing sports yet. Its been long since I used bluetooth headphones, have been using the wired ones from senheiser, bose and other brands, the good thing with this one is, I can connect to my phone and laptops at the same time, it pauses the videos on laptop when I get a phone call on my mobile. I think that is cool. And with the noise cancelling part, this one doesn't do a job on that part unless you keep volumes at very high levels to get you a headache. The sound quality is good for the price range. Nothing more on that. Bluetooth connectivity is pretty good, within 5 - 7 meters I guess, more than that there is distortion, noise and all the other wave range related problems. Buy this if you just need some good quality headphones for 6 - 8 months of usage."
416,3.0,Gotta say. The sound quality is garbage. I don't know what the other reviewers are smoking but the sound quality is reaaaly bad. It's muffled and booms and clarity is atrocious. Imagine hearing a waterfall with artificially boosted bass. I have a pair of 700 bucks sennheisers and they're MILES better. I only use these earphones for calls now.
417,1.0,"Bought this for 1999. I was hoping this would be better than the Chkoko earphones I owned. Build quality is flimsy, but I wasn't expecting any better for the price. The Bluetooth connection was smooth, but the range is that for 10 feet. Expect that to drop significantly if you walk out of the room or if there is a wall in between. Didn't fit into my ear very well and felt uncomfortable.
Was surprised by the distorted sound quality. I am not an audiophile but these earphones don't do justice oo higher volumes and on call mic operations. Would not recommend. Returned."
418,2.0,"BOAT Service Centre takes like forever to replace your defected product under warranty, They will pick up your product and will take a month to 'process your request', you will only be updated of the status until it goes to their service team, after that, you can just forget you ever had a boat earphones, it's actually better that way why waste your time attempting to contact them and constantly worry about the earphones that don't even last 4-5 months. Rather go for Sennheiser or some other trusted brands whose products actually last long and even if somehow the product fails the company will not abandon you with your defected product under warranty."
419,4.0,"All in all this could be the best wireless earphone in this range !!!!
Although it has some pros and con for which boat can overcome
Pros-
~the sound quality is so soothing
~ texture of bass is properly splited for both side .
~ built quality is also good , you can feel the toughness of the product.
~design and color texture is also fine.
~
Cons
~ battery is not uo the mark in one charge i.e within 45min full charge battery the output u can expect is 2 n half hour if u using it continuous or by keeping standby or with a call u can expect 2days battery backup.
~ the upper layer of the body leaves the material i mean thing poly coating gets automatically removed"
420,4.0,"Vocal is not Cristal clear
If u want to listen clear vocal u have to download 3rd party software. And if u use Samsung m series like m10,20 or 30 phone than there is no need to download 3rd party SOFTWARES,
BASS IS REALLY VERY VERY HIGH.
if u are a bass lover and u can compromise little with vocal than it's for you and if u can't compromise with vocal even 10% than I won't suggest to u"
421,5.0,"Overall the working is awesome. But I find a issue that the heavier earpiece will make you discomfort and in pain for using long usage.
Bass awesome
Sound awesome
Bluetooth connectivity excellent
Multi connect works good
Battery backup excellent (with help of power saving option you can get continuous play for 5-6 hrs and if we pause songs then the system goes to power save mode till if resume song.
I recommend it for music lovers."
422,5.0,"It’s good. Clear sound, Deep bass, fits well in the ear, has decent battery life. If you expect it to look premium, you will be disappointed. I find it just okay. The wire looks delicate and one might damage it if not used with care. It’s a rubber coated u bend and buttons are also coated. Felt the blue tooth connection a bit unreliable and I have often felt it to crash if your phone is kept in your trouser pocket. Connecting it to any device is easy and super quick and with no obstruction, it works fine.
Overall it’s okey for the price I paid (899₹)."
423,3.0,"Like many others have already written about it, the Bluetooth connectivity of this piece is embarrassing. You cannot stick your phone in your pocket or a bag and expect your songs to play without a glitch. The connectivity is really that bad. Boat needs to take this earphones off the market and fix the issue. Seriously"
424,5.0,"After months of research of which bluetooth earphone to buy, I decided to go for these and it was all worth it.
I'm a base loving person and I will say if you like base-y sound/music these are the earphones for you.
Battery life is really good, gets charged in an hour or so. Completely satisfied with this product.
Recommended by me."
425,2.0,Worst experience. After purchasing of 6 months one side ear phone not working and placed for return the boat company. They have picked up the item but not returned still even after 30 days. Very worst experience after using it for 6 months. My friends also has same complaint. Plz don't buy. The photo is uploaded of replaced ear phones. I have waited for more than 30 days for a small replacement. How can someone wait for so many days. The customer service shall be quick wen u have pblm. Plz don't ever buy this.
426,3.0,"U really need to vigilant when it comes to boat wireless,
I bought this three months back.
Initial all aspects looks good and it's gradually decreased in value.
Dual Bluetooth won't worked for me. I enquired with my fellow guys who bought this after me. Even they too find difficult in connecting two devices ie lap and mobile.
Later after lot of search, it worked and every time it made me to do the same process to get connected.

The mic is outside below Bluetooth and not inside ie near mouth, so it receives all the outer noise around you and your voice will not audible to the receiver end.

Bass is little low when compared with boat 225 wired headset.

Don't know how much charge utilized and always shows 80% and suddenly shows warning and switched off.

After two months of use, The earpiece wire got disconnected / tore on the right side ie Bluetooth side. When contacted Amazon, they told to register the product inorder to claim warranty. Also they told to look out for near service centre where we can change our product.

But in Chennai, no such stores available the nearest service centre is at Bangalore. The same reported to Amazon again, I was advised to look out of shops in local market area(Richie Street). I have told them that my product was registered in website and I didn't get any confirmation or registration code to activate or claim my warranty.

They asked me to search contact numbers in boat website and proceed further.

Twice I have registered the product and
It's been a month they(boat) have not acknowledge and send registeration code

@Amazon
U really need to look into this and arrange for replacement from your end as the manufacturer is not prompt in the registration process. Better u can arrange for replacement from the seller side which would ease the consumers difficulty"
427,1.0,"After receiving the headphone it was works fine but after 4 day's it stop working one side, later on I called amazon to return the product they straightway denied the same and said you have order it from the business account and return windows is closed, it has only 3 days return window instead of 10 days in regular accounts. then I contacted manufacturer for the replacement they took the product from me in 2 days after raising the compliant but it took 20 days to get the replace product. it is very very bad. my one month product warranty gone for toss."
428,3.0,"Good connectivity,
Good clarity while calling,
Good range,
Good functions,
Good battery backup,

Bad music quality my purpose for purchase was for talking on phone which is solved very good but while listening music this is very bad sounds mono type and low volume even in latest music."
429,2.0,"Sound quality isn't that good. Not worth the cost. Durability, well it comes with a plastic construction, that you need to wear around neck. So can't fit it in anything.

Feeling bad buying this product considering the image doesn't clarify the plastic ring around the neck. Oh yes one more thing Ear piece has rubber hook on it but design is so bad that you can't get it in ears properly."
430,1.0,"I am writing this review after using this for 4 complete days:

+ves
*compatible with neck and ears.
*Bluetooth connectivity is fast.
*look & design is awesome.

-ves
*earphone size is littlebit big: mainly with the earset which gives pain in ears when you mix helmet & earphones (while driving).
*finding disturbance in music when im “running” (probably due to connectivity issue)
*music: everytime When there is change in song or toggle between music/video/call/other, experiencing an irritative beep sound.
*Bass is not that good
*when im driving: (onCall) sound quality is low & bad and mic aswell.
*siri not working
*grip for earbuds/earset is low quality and can damage anytime
*when on call: other person keeps complaining about low voice and disturbance (..mic problem)
*most concerned and the biggest problem with this bluetooth earphones is BATTERY backup;
Even though when im not using bluetooth (call or music) battery discharging.
*very bad thing: battery/charging directly falls from 80% to 0% within no time.
*it is giving 3hours of battery backup only (at the max.

i am returning this product: mainly because of battery backup which is a big issue for any bluetooth device!

Really disappointed with the performance."
431,3.0,"Do not buy this. Go for zebronics journy instead. That is much more value for money product. There are three cons as per my usage:

When to turn on this bluetooth it will connect with all the mobile devices it was paired earlier. So u r listening two diffrent songs from two phones inthe same headphone at the same time...

Second it has three buttons n two humps on both side of buttons. So if u are using this headphone on bike ride, which i do n u r wearing gloves. U will end up pressing wrong button.

Third it created problem with samsung phone as it was not appearing in the available devices...

Though sound quality of this headphone is very good.."

433,4.0,"The sound quality is very good, obviously don't expect so much bass.
In terms of look, it is very much attractive.
Charging and power back up also promisable. Hoping for long lasting .
But worst part is about noise distortion while talking. Other side of the phone party keeps complaining about outside noise."
434,3.0,"Overall: Decent product, not worth the cost.

Issues below are experience over 1 week of using the product on iPhone 6.

Pros: Sturdy material, flexible behind the neck strap and wire quality durable and tangle free. Good battery life.

Cons: The device does not have good Bluetooth connectivity. If your phone is more that one foot away from you, the sound gets cut off very often. For example, if you have your phone in your handbag/backpack/pocket, you can expect multiple cut offs, especially while moving (walking, using a scooter/motorcycle). If you move further away you need to be in direct sight of the phone for continuous music (if you turn your back to the phone or if there is any obstruction (not even a wall, a bathroom stall door is all it takes) the music gets cut off. Not sure if it is just my piece but this is very frustrating.

The ear pieces have magnets so that it connects around your neck when not in use, however this makes each ear piece heavier, as a result if you are using smaller in-ear buds, they tend to fall out due to the weight of the ear piece. This becomes a hassle while working out, particularly jogging/running."
435,1.0,"I am trying to use it for calls. But there is too much noise and other person is not getting my voice. So I think waste of money to purchase this. I can connect this device to two platform computer or mobile. But there will be noise while using it. Within a month it's stopped working now. Useless product, Please don't purchase it. It's stopped charging now. You have to disconnect one device then you can take the call."
436,5.0,"I am more of a calling person rather than music one. I carry two phones which keeps on ringing alternatively throughout the day (don't worry i dont work in a call centre 😝). The biggest reason why i opted for a Bluetooth earphone was to protect my phone's from the sweat as i live in a humid area and also to avoid direct exposure to radiations to a certain extent. I did a lot of research but nothing couldn't convince me so i thought of purchasing Bluetooth headset of reconnect (reliance electronics brand) which costed me Rs 1000/-. It is a decent product to start with but will always be in back of your mind as you have to keep adjusting it time and again. Also the battery would last only 4 to 5 hours with my time of calling. Also the other person on call used to complain very often about the poor voice quality. Then i switched to boat rockers and trust me it's all together a different experience with almost similar price. The neck band will ensure its stability and it lasts almost the whole day even after 100 calls a day. And after almost a month of usage, nobody has raised concern about poor audio quality."
437,1.0,"Very bad product, i wqs fan of boat till i bought this ear phones, i bought two of these ans within 3 months one sidded stopped working of both earphones. I sent for replacement from official sites and they send me msg after 10 months that some guy from courier company will pick up fauly earphones but no one is coming since 10 days after msg, i am continuously calling that xpressbess guy but he answring like i will come this time and that time but he never comes. Worst product, worst service Dont buy."
438,1.0,"It was going exactly so good untill three days.It showed low battery and plugged it in to the charger and since then it is not working.I did not expect this from ""AMAZON"" neither from ""BOAT""
The worst part is have misplaced the recieptamd neither do I have the box in which it came..
How do I reclaim my headphones.It was excellent the sound quality was very good but the issue which I faved,I never expected this from this company of such high stature.
Amazon please look into this matter"
439,4.0,"First of all, for 999 it's the best.
So I'm reviewing this as a 13-1500 rs device.
After 3 months of usage-
Soung quality is very good for the price.
Bass is also very good.
Range is 'decent'.
You'll become used to in 2-3 days of usage it's comfortable (it's light as )
Connectivity and usability is also very easy.
Mic will work well most of the time, just ensure it's at the right place.
But one thing I'd say you after 3 months of usage that build quality us 'above average' that's all, especially you have to be very careful with the wires."
440,3.0,"Although I thought this will be an amazing purchase as I bought certain speakers of boat earlier, but i was very disappointed.

Cons:
1.Mids are completely missing.
2.Too much bass. Ruins the quality of music
3.Hurts when listening loud.

Pros:
1.Light weight.
2.Wont fall of while running or something.

Conclusion: Do not buy if you are an audiophile. If you are ok with too much bass compromising quality of music while working out, then go for it."
441,5.0,"Exactly as per description. Super product. Pods fit snugly into the ear and the guide to the inside of the ear for stability. Will remain secure with head movement associated with physical activity. Cord lengths are good enough for big head sizes also. Feature of magnetic connect of the two sides when not being used ensures that the accessory will not fall off when hung around the neck and not being used. Very good sound quality. Noise cancellation is excellent too as even when the pods are in the ear, you can barely hear the person opposite to you talking in their normal voice."
442,1.0,I bought two rockerzz 255. A good sound in this price and good backup......But after using 5-6 months both of them had same problem. One oh the ear piece stopped working. One was used by me in Delhi whereas other was used by family members. No wear n tear but still stopped and sometimes give sound for a second or two. It is not easy to get warranty complaint. Neither online nor on phone.Planning to visit service center. So device is good but seems there is some manufacturing defects and service is not also up to the mark which should be as it is growing company....if it continues then Boat will be also like Micromax
443,5.0,"After using the product for more than two months, I am posting the review: this is the best budget Bluetooth Wireless Earphone for all my needs: be it the official calls when connected to laptop or smartphone, or for watching movies, this one does the job. Highly recommended from my end.

With Love,
Sarav"
444,4.0,"Firstly the voice quality of the product is very nice compared to others at this range, however the service from boat side is not right. Mu product was damaged at the 7th day and I initiated the replacement option, the reverse pick up was scheduled however no delivery information is available still. Itz being 3 days now, when you go to boat website the tracking status button does not works on the website and even you cannot reach an representative via call. I don't know if I am gonna receive the product back or not!"
445,4.0,"I was hesitate to Buy after using lg hbs750 but then show entirely changed, use the frist time impressed wll handle small features, ur mobile in DND u get voice messages incoming call pretty cool 😎 sound quality good and noise canceling best
Testing 5d songs wearing this u will locw it
Last but not least its fit inside the helmet ⛑"
446,3.0,"If you have heard Sony before then you won't like these.
Average base.
Average noise cancelation
Looks premium
Good to hold
Battery back is not so good
Last about 2-3 hours
Will have to change every day.
When battery is low it gives repeated warnings which are irritating
Battery drains fast"
447,5.0,"I really like this set. It's better than the one I got from the US. The drivers in this one are very good. I recommend this set.
UPDATE: after using it for 9 months.
1 side of the earphone has become very low. The one I got from the US is still working very well. I use the 1 from the US more than this one. I will not buy this brand again."
448,4.0,"I'm reviewing this product after using it for 6 months. Let me tell you the pros and cons:-
Pros:-
1) Great bass
2) Great product design
3) Easy controls.
4) Easy to use
5) Fluent connectivity
6) Best price(Buy it under 1000₹)
7) Great vocals
Cons:-
1) Too much loud bass
2) After sales service poor as compared to other brands.
3) 6 hours of battery back up
Note:-
Replaced the product after 5 months of use. One side wasn't working. Took almost 2 months for replacement. Don't buy for a price tag over 999.."
449,5.0,"So, If ur looking for a balanced product around 1-1.5k price point these are the best u can get. Bass & Sound quality on this one is great. Bass is bit more but can obviously be adjusted using music players & Noise cancellation on this is great. Best part is battery. Battery of this product is like awesome & recharge time is also less so that is what makes it special & fits in ears perfectly. And also cable quality seems good. So, Yes it's an even deal go for it & enjoy ur Boat rockerzzz."

While using this this earphone voice of song touch in heart.. 💓..."
451,5.0,These are the first wireless earphones I'm using after using normal earphones for several years. I'm extremely impressed with the sound quality and also how comfortable they are even if you are someone like me who listens to podcasts or music for several hours at a stretch. I had to change the earbuds to the smallest size from the standard size that are part of the package. Bluetooth connectivity is great since I've used them with my mobile as well as TV and PC (using a transmitter) and never faced any issues or disturbance. Battery life is also pretty good around 5-6 hours and charging barely takes an hour. The sound is crystal clear and for the price its available at it is real value for money.
452,1.0,"For first couple of months the earphone was excellent n I have referred it to many office colleagues .

Later one side of it wasn't working whenever there was low battery, thought it would be some technical issue and I've kept for charging in that case

But now it's totally stopped working n I'm unable to reach out to Boat Support on this ."
453,2.0,"Terrible sound quality. I don't have much idea about songs from the EDM, pop genre but if you are one who's into rock/metal or the likes then stay as far away from this as possible. The sound clarity is terribly. Lows can be lived with, the mids would make you hate your decision to buy, the highs would make you kill yourself. Noise cancellation is satisfactory but nothing beyond that. Charging never seemed a hassle to me and lasts a decent amount of time on battery. Build quality is good however it's only been a week. In terms of comfort, never really had any issues despite running it for a continuous 2-3 hours once. Buds are soft and fit in snugly. Bluetooth connectivity is strong, however there are times when the connection stutters.
And yes, it cannot be refunded,only replaced. So purchase wisely."
454,1.0,"I purchased this in Jan 19 for Rs 1000 as part of some sale. Firstly, I was very diappointed to see that left side of the earphones stopped working within 5 months i.e. June itself. But I thought it is okay since the product was still under warranty, but let me tell you all.. I LOGGED THE REPLACEMENT SERVICE REQUEST IN JULY AND IT HAS STILL NOT BEEN REPLACED!!!!
I never expected such bad customer service. Since July i have called their customer service a thousand times but it always says that all executives are busy currently. Then I raised another request online, still nothing to that too.
I am planning to take it to consumer forum now

So my conclusion is product is bad as it has chances of getting faulty anytime (in my case as early as 5 months) and service is even worse!"
455,3.0,"I like the product but some how when i open the parcel its box seal is broken. May be some one return the package and they gave me that broken seal package that i dont like, Thats is why i am giving 3 star otherwise product is good."
456,1.0,"The headphone looked awesome over the internet. It looks grey physically too... But it has the worst performance of any headphones that I have used. First of all, it does not connect properly to phones. It takes a lot of time to get discovered.
Sound quality is ok, but when listening to music, clarity is not there at all. JBL or Skull candy is far far better than this. Even when connected, when I am receiving a call, it is making some robotic sound, hence the voice of the caller is not at all clear. Initially I thought it may be due to low charge or network congestion. But even with a full charge and strong network it does that.
The mouthpiece is also of a very poor quality. People complain that they are unable to hear my voice, when in reality I am literally shouting at this end.
Also the ear buds are uncomfortable.

So all in all, please refrain yourself from buying this crap. Instead go for any other headphones."
457,4.0,The item is superb but less of delicate in terms of earbud & ear holders. They get off even on slight friction. So basically you can't wear it if you want to be even in a lil crowdy area. I loved this product due to its sound quality & the power backup. But you need to be extra careful while you wear it.
458,1.0,"So here we go again. You move away from boat cause you have used it and it hardly works for more than 3 months.

One of your supposedly tech expert friend buys a new boat headset and goes crazy making you think if the new product is really as good as he says.

You read reviews (should be paid as most of them are positive) and start going over the technicalities.

Amazon has a sale slashing the prize by 500.

You go ahead and buy one.

Boom!! Three months and one side of headset goes either blank or too low to hear anything

You try for a replacement but they point you to a shop on the corner of the city (Imagine my plight as I stay in Bangalore)

You throw this useless headphones away and go back to your old Sony headphones which look so outdated now but seems to work just as perfectly as it did since the day you bought. Oh, it's couple of years old as well."

Battery back up is decent. 6 hours in high volume)(not recommended) and 10 hours for a decent level volume and sometimes more than 10 hrs 😊

Grip is really nice. Sticks to ears properly. The charger that we get along with the headset is a nice product. Chargers quickly in about 20 mins charge for 3 hrs playback time. Cooooool isn't??? 💪

Thank you Boat alias Nirvana!"
470,1.0,"This is bad product in the sense that it works for a couple of months and then one headphone stops working and after a few days the other one too stops working. The worst thing is that the company sells this product under replacement warranty of one year, meaning that they will replace the product within one ear, but when you call their helpline no one picks up the phone, the website does not work. Seems like a fraud company with fly by night ethics. I had bought two headsets-- one for myself and one for my brother. Both of them stopped working within 3 months."
471,3.0,"Overall quality is good, however it is certainly not the best choice to take phone calls.

472,2.0,"Thanks to Amazon ,I had waited for so many months to purchase this item,nice product.
Most important is product is faulty, audio sound of call is so low ,i can not able to voice of other side, well now I am trying to contact with customer care of boat,but office is closed in Monday also, it is my suggestion to Amazon before send the product to customer, are they confirmed that product is in good condition ."
473,4.0,"I just want to tell you guys go for it. As I purchased @999 only.
( It's not good for gaming. )
( But good for playing videos, listening
musics/songs. )

*Noise Cancellation*
Its noise cancelation is awesome it cancel all the outer sound & stops reaching to our ears which prevents the internal musics/songs from outer noise, which we were listening.

*Bluetooth Connectivity*
Once you connect to your device & after that whenever you will try to connect, it will connects in a second only. Connectivity is too fast.

*Sound Quality*
As I see its sound is not so clear just because of its high bass but not too bad also. When you play music it is good but while playing online multi-player games some time voice is not so clear it feels like heavy sound is initiated through it. Bass is too good.

*Some More Info*
It has three buttons on right side of bands: Upper button [ + ], Middle Button [ O ], Down Button [ - ] & a charging port respectively.
Upper button is used to increase the volume by just a click & to play the next/upcoming musics/songs press it for few second.
Middle button is used to power on or off by pressing it for few seconds & also used to control Google Assistant by pressing it for few seconds which which should be less than its power on or off timing.
Down button is similarly used to down the volume by just a click & to play the previous musics/songs by pressing it for few seconds.

At last I want to say overall it is good product & purchase it without any hesitation at this price ₹999. Actually the cost of this product is about ₹1499.

Thanks!"
474,5.0,"Build: Well designed, lightweight and comfortable. The wires are good and not flimsy, wearing comfort is well maintained, better than Mi bluetooth earphones( the main competitor of boAt in the 1499 price category).

Comfort: As mentioned above, these earphones are really comfortable, fits in the ear with no chance of slipping out (unless you're trying desperately and internationally). They're lightweight, so no hazard on that department. Perfect for long hours of music playback.

Sound: The most important aspect of an earphone is the sound clarity, and boAt surely doesn't disappoint here as well. A bit base heavy but the sound is clear, crisp and loud. Good noise cancellation also helps to isolate the music playback. Although, judging from a pure audiophile's point of view, the Mi bluetooth earphones might have a more balanced sound signature, but boAt, being a bit base heavy, is just awesome for hip-hops or Bollywood genres. A music player with a good equalizer (preferably Poweramp for android) is going to elevate the listening experience even more.

Battery: A single charge gives about 6-7 hours of music playback, which is decent enough, and full charge takes roughly about 1-1.5 hours.

Verdict: In a nutshell, boAt Rockerz 255 is worth the price tag and then some. With it's better build quality, comfort, bluetooth range, it packs more punch than it's competition. For the extreme purists, the sound signature might be a bit turn off, but for most people, even for people with good ears, this is going be a great experience."
475,4.0,"Disclaimer: This is big detailed review.

Bluetooth Earphones are of good quality. Sweat and water-resistant. Charging time is ~40 minutes. Works for 4-5 hours use straight. And can be on standby mode for 6-8 hours. Hence overall covers 10-14 hours usage initially if you are migrating from good pain of wired earphone like jbl cs100si or scheniser CX180 you will feel its sound somewhat different with extra base. However, you can control sound profile using installing Equilizer app from play store.
However, one thing is important this is not that much suitable for runners. When I start running with them its neckband and battery unit starts oscillating over my neck. Earbuds remain fix on ears due to the extensions provided with it however this neckband and battery units are not at all that much stable.
So if you are planning to use these for day to day use then this is great Bluetooth earphone. But if you are trying to pair them while running then this is not at all a suitable match.
In addition, the design is such that after wearing them around neck cables creates a sharp bend near the battery unit which is a matter of concern and can cause Bluetooth Earphones to go bad in short time.
I almost forgot about keys provided on the neckband. These are great, tactile and highly responsive. Google Assistant also works flawlessly with the help of them. Range wise if you are in the same room around 10-12 feets distant from mobile then these earphones works best. After that, if you increase distance further or change room and go to the next room some glitches in sound occurs.
I almost forgot about one thing the storage for these earphones. It is very difficult to store them in any container or box as compared to any other wired earphone which you can wrap and place in any box or pouch. Hence as you cannot wound it you have to always wear them on the neck. No other option, you cannot just slip them in the last pocket of your backpack as this can cause harms to cables. This is almost annoying for me every time."
476,2.0,"It's been 5 days only that I have bought this product....
Cons:
-10m bluetooth connectivity is a myth, it only supports upto 3-5 m.
-wires are not quite durable or thick.
-Bass is lower than average.
-not durable for long run
-ears starts to pain after a use of 30min.
Pros:
-gets charged quickly.
-light weight
-gets connected quickly,no problem in connection.

So, for me this product is lower than average.Now it's up to you,so think twice before buying thus product."
477,4.0,"Kudos to the product, for giving this sound quality in this price point. Got it for 1000 bucks on sale . But considering the original price bracket i would definitely recommend you to add 2-300 bucks and buy realme bluetooth earphones coz the ony drawback i found in these is its mic quality, most of the times it picks external voices more then yours which causes disruption and flickered tone. Rest sound quality is good"
478,1.0,"If you love muddy sound and only want to hear bass ,yes you can waste your precious time and money on this earphones. My old nokia earphones were more clear in terms of sound

It looks like boat just increased the bass and forgot about every other thing.

Watched some movies too and voice of actors was muffling as hell

But anyway i would say order one and check it ur self. Becoz you can return it back and get it back in Amazon pay."
479,3.0,"I have been using this since 3 days. Liked it, but price (1500) is a bit more. Overall its a good buy. Sound quality is great.

Reviewing after 12 days of use:

Don't believe in charging time of 6 hours as they said. I am literally getting not more than 3hrs. Hence, reduced my rating from 4 to 3."
480,5.0,"I have gifted this earphones to my brother and he is actually very happy with it. He impressed with built quality, length of earphone wire, sound quality and noise cancellation. I can say that in 900 rs i have found a fantastic deal on amazon.
Thanks #Boat.. although i really wanted to buy the blue ones but you have not reduced the cost to 999 in sale. No worries, black is also good."
481,4.0,"Battery life is good but not that great, expecting bit more for this price.

Wearing comfort is good, connecting process with phone is very easy and fast."
482,4.0,"Evrything is good about this product. Sound quality, Bass, bluetooth connectivity, battery backup-approx 6 hrs. Charging time is about 1 hr to 1.30 hrs

483,3.0,"Bought Boat rockerz 255 in April 2019.
Initially the product was good.
However the right handside earphone is not working now and not sure if this will be covered in my warranty.
Have tried all possible ways to rectify but in vain.
Doubting the quality of such a simple product which is not durable.

Raised a complaint once the right ear phones were not working. After 3 weeks the same was serviced ( faulty product picked up, serviced and delivered).
But the problem surfaced again after 3 months. Right ear phone not working again.
Looks like they have compromised on the quality of something basic. Thumbs down to Boat Rockerz 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼"
484,3.0,"Cons: 1. Too Bassy! Mudding all tones.
2. Unable to listen all instruments getting
played due to heavy bass.
3. Even Bass is not best which lacks clear
thump.
4. BT connection always requires line of
sight. Poor reception within rooms.
5. Battery life average.

Pros:
1. Noise cancellation is great.
2. Bulit quality is good although plastic.
3. Call quality seems fine. No complaint received from far end so far. However, Bass comes to picture even for voice.
4. Bass centric. But don't expect much from bass also."
485,3.0,"After two months review.
1) Poor Bluetooth Range: It often gets disconnected due to poor range, you even can't go to your balcony/kitchen.
2) No auto connectivity and smooth Multi-connectivity: No auto-connectivity when you come back in its short range and you have to switch it on first if you hadn't connected another device with it and, if you had then you have to struggle to connect your device.
3) Good bass, noice cancellation and sound quality.

Earlier, I was using Boult Probass Audio, it didn't have connectivity issue though but, noise cancellation & audio quality were very poor. I bought this because of the foreign brand but, it has its own different problems.
Seems like there is no bluetooth earphone within Rs1500."
486,1.0,Bluetooth connectivity issues always i need boat company is not doing properly QA testing . All boat product is used to damaged very soon and thay dont have service centre as well on Bangalore
487,4.0,"I have both boat wired headsets and sound magic. Both of them have rich bass. I love them totally & am using from past few years.
This wireless in-ear headsets doesn't have the richness in bass. May be the quality is compromised somewhere between the wired & wireless.
Except for this one drawback, this product is bang for the bucks you pay. It's lightweight, comfortable, long playtime and the offer price of 999 is excellent.
If you're okay with decent bass, this is for you.
Apparao retail seller is doing a great job regarding offers & return requests."
488,1.0,Writing review after using 2 months of the product. Initially the sound quality was good and the connectivity was also good. But after one month of use connectivity problem started. After two month of use one day it suddenly got turned off and I was not able to turn ON the device. I registered complaint on there website and after 2 weeks they pick up the device and now after 2 week they collected for there pick up service. I will never going to buy there product. Pathetic service. Totally time and money wasting.
489,1.0,"Whats the use of wireless earphone when there is a connectivity issue when i put my Phone in pockets the music disturbs(sounds begins to stuck), thats irritating. Never expected from BOAT. I have used 3 wired earphones of this BRAND which sounds good. The music quality is awesome. I purchased this as to use while working out, jogging, listening music while travelling, whats the use of wireless headphone when you have to keep it in the upper pocket always. I don t know i have got a defective piece. I have ordered the replacement of the same. Will review further if this issue is solved. If unsolved than no point of buying this earphones. In the box its given for 10m but shocked to see its gets fluctuated even at less than meter. And of the obstacles walls we can understand, I means putting in jeans and travelling is so much common. @ boat please do reply if you read ."
490,2.0,"I like Boat products especially their speakers, I have 2 of them and they have excellent connectivity but these headphones have terrible connectivity. Max range is 8-10m and clear sound only if there is no obstacle in between you and the phone but once there is a wall or anything else there's static sounds"
491,4.0,"Con(s) : The only con is it has an ugly design....yep ugly....when you are using the product it doesn't look good on you.

Pros:
1. The sound quality - I feel it's on par with few flagship earphones. Worth at this price range.
2. Noise cancellation - to some extent does the job, due to to its bud design and due to the rubber tip.
3. Bluetooth connectivity - am mostly near my phone, so that wasn't a problem for me. Few metres should be fine.
4. Battery life - playtime got about 6 hours. Standby time is great - lasted many days for me.
5. Portability - the whole texture is kinda rubberish, so you can fold it and keep it anywhere.
6. Water resistant - got it wet on the rain once, worked fine.

Thanks"
492,3.0,"Quality wise OK / Better battery back up is good
But for replacement service is very worst,
If Amazon Team not involved in the support.... I couldn't get my replacement

I would suggest to go with sennheiser headphones
That's good quality headphones with excellent sounds clarity.... And worth of money."
493,4.0,"Voice cancellation is jus not available. In six months off light use (twice a week) already one side earphone has got loose connection... Totally a no...
This was my review at 6 mos, I claimed for warranty online, they picked up product and replaced it. Totally hassle free exchange.. So that's commendable I guess.. So giving 4 star sound has been great always especially the bass. Awesome service guys👌 go for it"
494,5.0,"After all trails waxed up with high priced bluetooth devices like (bose),JBL Sony...
As a lost trail I purchased boat ...as my friends r saying it's good but the price was low compare with others including Samsung level 3 ....but my first look ...its cathy and tried with my I phone and android it's great in sound.....at present if it stays like that for 1yr..also I ll b happy ..."
495,1.0,Battery life is good . I don't know suddenly it started to fully charged but when tried to power on its not working. It's only 1 month I hardly used it and it's gone no use now . Totally waste of money . I recommend not to buy
496,4.0,"It's one day use... will write later--
After 5 days use i have found one issue. that battery is getting drain within 1 hour from 60% to 0% and get switch off.

Pro:
Good sound quality
good battery until 60%
Good quality for this price
Quick connection
2 device connection
noise cancel

Con:
Battery after 60%

For battery issue i made replacement.
so i got new one today 11/22/2019. : )
Will check and update the status.

Hi Got replacement.
after 1 month use am updating below
sound/battery/bass/clarity all so good
realy worth for money. dont wait grab it."
497,3.0,"Issues.

Cinnectivity.
---------------
The Bluetooth connectivity is not at all good. Just breaks some times. Not at all recommended for gym workout( atleast not for cardio.) Stopped working many times when I had a good amount of sweat.

Sound.
I am a bass lover and always a budget guy. Till now used different kinds of in ear earphones. Senhizer cx 180.. jbl . Panasonic, boat, etc.. all in same range approx. But i still prefer senihizer cx 180 over boat 225. Boat just has too much of base the voice mainly feels submerged. I had to turn off all the equalizers ( music app and mobile ) so that I could get a better voice..however it feels too bass. Atleast not while listening to music but it feels while watch a movie speciallly Hollywood.

Disappointed a bit.. satisfiesld a bit.. but majorly disappointed"
498,3.0,W/L earphone in 1-1.5K price range. Handle carefully for 1st 1 week to understand different feature capability. Had many -ve reviews on Amazon but I still opted for it. Incidentally all is well till now after 1 month use. Little problem in call/audio management but that's not a major issue. Same feature of JBL is on higher price rande (4K) so not bad this one.
499,4.0,"Got it for a good discounted price 999!
Earphone looks good and the built quality too for the Boat price bracket.
Sound is good, but not that high as wired boAt BassHeads 225!
Feels not that great fit, as a neck band & need to check on Battery back up.
Boat, Amazon & Appario Retail Private Ltd good job!"
500,1.0,"The earpiece is not very soft.... Noise cancellation is good.. Bluetooth connectivity is very poor..I didn't like it... Phone was in my pocket and it was losing it very often... That sucks..is bought it for 1k .if you want wait for offer..
Edit- i want to return now after 12 days..but unfortunately it was 10days...now I'm contacting company"
501,1.0,Battery Backup Not good I had issues with Battery performance it last for me about 1.5 hour in continuous Usage.. And If You are Bass Lover then only go For that Audio Quality Isn't Great And at Some Point of Time After Cointnues listening You might feel pain in Your Ears.. I Would Advice not to Go with this Product don't Purchase and i am Reviewing it after 11 days of continues usage.. I am Sending it back In return Not Satisfied disappointed with This.
502,5.0,The earphone is pretty good. The grip is excellent. It does not move when you workout. It provides decent sound insulation. The sound quality is pretty good. The battery backup is good. I could play music constantly for around 8 hours before it discharged from full charge. It takes around 1.5 to 2 hours to charge it from 0% to 100%
503,1.0,Please be careful. This one stopped working in a few months. I exchanged it with BOAT on their official website. I did receive another one. But it stopped working exactly after one week. This is very disappointing.
504,4.0,"I am using the earphones for two months now.
Sound quality is good. Charging lasts for a day at the most. Dual connect feature is unique and awesome. You can connect on laptop as well as your phone at the same time. You can pause audio/video in one device and play in other device. Band is flexible which increases it's durability. While Sony offers better Bluetooth earphones at higher prices with longer battery life it lacks this flexibility. Noise cancellation does not work properly. If you are travelling and speaking on a call the other person will understand that you are travelling which is not the case with Sony earphones. One should assess one's needs and choose one to go for.
Unlike Boat headphones it does not sound outside when turned On/Off (Those who have used Boat headphones will understand this better)."
505,3.0,"Adding review after using this headphone for more than 6 months, actually i have not used it more thn 2 months, i dont know why , but somehow maby because of charging the headphone was quite boring for me, the headphone has verygood noise qulity, which is not good for me as used to travel a lot on bike, so i must hear the surrounding sound for safety reasons. This is my personal experience
Rest about the headphone, the sound quality is good, balanced, bass is also nice. Build quality is awesome. If u r ok with charging it every day go for it.. i got it for 999.."
506,5.0,"Hello Guys,

This is Moorthy Shettiyar......After watching en number of videos & reviews I ordered this product yesterday at 10:00pm and today in the afternoon at 12:30pm I got the product.....very fast delivery........keep it up Amazon & team

Now let's talk about the product....

First of all the quality of the product is awesome.....
It's superb durable......nice tangle free cable....also I love that magnetic bounding between each other.....

Now let's talk about the sound & call quality....

Sound signature is literally superb guys It's beyond to my expectations...I was planning to buy realme buds wireless but I thought let's give it a try & really guys m very much impressed with the sound quality.....

For sound signature I would rate 10 /10.

Highs, lows, mids, vocals and bass everything is Crystal clear ....It's worth buying @999/- I strongly recommend to buy this product it won't let u down...

Boat rocks…................"
507,4.0,"I got this for Rs. 999 and have been using it for about two weeks. So far I have used it to listen to music on Moto G4 Plus and some other phones, and I've used it to watch movies on my laptop. While the Bluetooth connection to my phone was seamless, it was a little difficult to connect to the laptop.

Sound Quality: 4/5
Bass Quality: 4/5
Noise Cancellation: 4/5
Design: 4/5
Packaging: 5/5

Pros:
1. Easy to use.
2. Great sound quality.

Cons:
1. Wires are a little long.
2. Simultaneous Bluetooth connection to 2 devices did not work for me."
508,4.0,"Well, initial impressions are good. Got it for around rs 870 applying discount. The Amazon advertisement page shows
BT 4.2, but the seller is selling BT 4.1. Previously was having JBL Infinity Glide 100, well those were having pretty below average sound quality, however the Bluetooth range in those was good (BT 5.0) , so returned them.
These Boat Rokerz have awesome sound quality, however the Bluetooth range (4.1) is not that great but can't complaint more considering the price nd sound quality.
Noise Cancellation remains to be checked. Build quality is superb.
(I got Black nd my frnd got Neon, well Neon colour is looking super awesome. Buy Neon colour if u buy these)
Will update after using for few more days."
509,1.0,"I cursed the manufacturer and bought a Sony product. No noise cancellation, rather it catches noise, the person on the other side of phone an only hear noises rather than your voice. Sound is okay quality. Go for JBL of same price, they have better mic, I personally have used them. The only positive thing is that you can connect two devices simultaneously with this BT headphone."
510,1.0,"Noise Cancellation was good - but as well it comes at the cost of you having to poke it in your ears.
I have had better sound quality at the same price range
Bluetooth range is as good as normal bluetooth headaphone - however, negative points as it doesnt turn off automatically.

On top of all that, within 3 months, the left ear piece stopped working.

Even though there is warranty - there is a really impractical and stupid policy.
I am from Bangalore - they say that if there is a service center in the city then, they wont pick it up for free - the Bangalore service center is 30 KMs from the center - it makes no sense for me to go there or even courier the earhones - it will cost me the same as buying new ones ....

When i went to Amazon's review is see that there are multiple people facing the same issue . I say Boat is a bad company but as well Amazon is at fault for recommending as ""Amazon's Choice"" for such a low quality product."
511,1.0,"Sound quality is not that good as compare to wire
Short range some time base did not come at all some connections problems"
512,3.0,"The headphones are definitely build to last. They have metal heads. There are different size of ear tips which is great. The magnet in the heads is also great and strong. They are comfortable to wear in long durations
Sound-
The sound is not so great but considering the price i would say its ok-ish. The bass is enhanced and produces a thumping effect. That's it. The mid and lows have are not at all clear and get drowned due to the enhanced bass.
Bluetooth range is good and since they are in ear types so they do provide a good seal cutting major sounds around you .
Call quality is again OK-ish
They are a no go for an audiophile or some one who listens to mellow songs
Go for them only if you are tight on budget ( got it for ₹999/- ) and are ready to compromise other tones for the bass"
513,2.0,"Though sound quality is good (according to it's price). I would suggest u to simply switch off the dolby music in ur phone settings to enjoy the original boat.

My concern is about it's battery life... it's not been a month and it started creating problem. Showing 50 to 60% battery and fall to 10 instantly.

hardly gives 3 hrs irrespective of what volume u r using it. I bought it for 999 and I found it not worth for it's price."
514,4.0,"So I used it for a while and really loved the quality of the product. The sound is crisp and loud which is best. The battery backup is amazing! I really loved it. But recently I realize that when I connect to my Mac Air, it shows that it's connected but the audio still plays in my Mac (Works perfectly fine on mobiles though). The replace date has expired and now I cannot do anything. I hope I get some good response from the seller."
515,3.0,"Apart from bluetooth not connecting automatically to paired devices, everything else is great.
Bluetooth connects automatically to last paired device, not to the nearest one.
I used a jabra one before this. It could connect automatically to the nearest device or the one which was currently ON.
Here we need to pair again even if only device(previously paired) is active at a moment."
516,2.0,"So i have used this bluetooth headset for a month as my daily driver, left side speakers just stopped one day while listening to music so i logged a complaint with customer service and they came to pickup the defective one in next 2 days, after that from last 15 days i didn't heard back from them, even the customer care numbers is useless since nobody picks up the call there. till date i have not received my replacement or repaired headset. overall good headset considering the price but extremely pathetic customer service towards customers from OEM, I would suggest rather go for Phillips, Sony, Mi or any other reputed brand since they provide excellent customer satisfaction."
517,5.0,"Product stands and works good for price 999/-
Charging time last for 4-5hrs in continuous usage.
Bass is high even for non-bass audio/video.
Call calrity is OK but not experiencing impressive noise cancellation while on calls. Must buy to enjoy bass music in this price range 👍"
518,4.0,"--- Reviewing after 2 months of use ---

Very happy with the boAt Rockerz 255 Sports Bluetooth Wireless Earphone.

Pros
- Sporty look and feel
- Great audio quality.
- Pairs seamlessly with two simultaneous devices. Used it with my mobile and laptop.
- Has decent battery life.
- Fits perfectly in the bowl of the ear making it suitable for running as well.
- Well priced.

Cons:
- If you are taking calls on both your mobile and laptop (VoIP), then the mobile always take precedence and interrupts the call on the laptop. I generally ended up disconnecting my mobile before getting on a call from my laptop. Not really an issue if you are only listening to music on your laptop.
- Ear clip felt a bit hard in the first few days so couldn't keep it in ear for more than an hour or two.
- Ear clip can become loose and fall off.

Would I buy it again?
Most likely"
519,3.0,"Hi All,

I purchased this product, Everything seems to be fine except below things due to that i requested Amazon for return the same and they are

1) At low volume of music you will continuous listen the humming sound (Means not music sound, Sounds which speaker generated by own) which is very discomfort for Ear and this is major issue, due to this i requested for return

2) Cables length is quite long, Which not looks good when it hang till near to your stomach but above of that (5'6)

3) To fit the noise cancel soft bud you have to enter speaker very deep in ear, so for long term in and out activity like this to your ear probably can make ear hearing problem."
520,5.0,"PROS

material quality is GOOD.
sound quality is great.
Durable Enough.
earpieces are good. Earpieces Fit properly in ears.
The microphone works fine.
Bluetooth connectivity is Good. Connects with both PC and MOBILE very easily.
Voice Acknowledgements are great in this Earphone. ( for switch ON, Switch OFF & Connectivity)
There is a small light Indicator on the Earphone that works fine.
We can charge the Earphone through adaptor or USB.

CONS

As it is a Bluetooth Earphone, therefore, it works great within a certain range. Try not to go too far from your Device(Mobile or PC )
While Commuting If the volume is too high, The earphone cancels all the noise around us. This can be dangerous.

Overall this product is great . Whether you are using it for Voice or Video calls or listening to music (soft or high bass) or listening to any video lecture."
521,3.0,"Been 2 months since I bought it. The left side stopped working gradually and now the volume has became so low..
Guess it’s better to opt for better branded products at similar price!
There is literally no service centre in Bangalore for this product. Travelled like 13 kms to a place which looks more then a residential home then a service centre.. and only be told to register online as services are only done in Mumbai. Better not buy from Bangalore for convenience sake. 🙄"
522,4.0,This product was purchased for gifting purposes - the feedback received from the person who is actually using this product is that they are happy with this product and besides excellent sound quality it is comfortable to wear - will consider to purchase for 2nd time - Amazon delivery is lightning fast and the product packaging was good
523,5.0,Very happy with the product. Been using it for last one month. Pairing in seconds. Sound quality is pretty good. I mostly use it for listening to music from Spotify/ Gaana. It comes with 3 different sizes of plug. I changed to small one which fits well in my ears. The legs are rubbery and very flexible so sits in the ear properly. Go for it!!
524,4.0,"Better sound and quality. Value for money.

Two things which bothers me.
1: The controller on the head phone is not that great. Feels like you are touching a wood. Not a smooth plastic. Would appreciate a smooth finish.

2: The description say it supports dual connectivity.
Yes it supports. But there is some issue on handling it. Ex: i connect to my PC and phone.. but when i get a phone call I couldn't answer the call.

And feedback voice for connecting and disconnecting is bit horrible."
525,5.0,"it has extreme bass and a great extent noise cancellation and decent sound clarity.
It has a mindblowing battery which gives 7-8 hrs music playback time . It's mic is also good & you will not be disappointed with the voice quality. But more than putting 2 hrs it feels very uncomfortable to me bcz of its conical buds(can be removed). It's Wires are a bit long which makes it odd in looking.
It's long wires really disappointed me.
Its packaging is bad.
Otherwise it is a very good headphone in this price segment. I really liked it."
526,5.0,"Worth for money...
Connectivity is awesome..
U gonna love the base.. its really too much..
And most importantly battery life , many reviews says it's exhaust fast but I bet u can't increase the volume above 40% it's more than enough to listen a pleasurable song, and at this rate battery will last more than 6 hours for sure😎🤟🤟 go for it.. and don't forget to register your product for warranty claim."
527,5.0,"Got these mainly for my gym sessions.

Build: 4/5
Battery: 3.5/5
Sound Quality: 4/5 (good bass)
Connectivity: 3.5/5

The build quality is pretty good and sturdy.

The battery level is displayed on the phone once connected which helps me know when I have to charge it.

The battery life is also fair enough, you can use it for a good 3-4 hours listening to music at 40-60% Volume.

But once the battery level reaches 20%, the battery will last no longer than 15 minutes. Generally, if you see a phone's battery, it drains out slower when it's below 15%.

If you do use it at max volume, I'm sure you won't be hear anything but the music, so if that's ""Noise Cancellation"", then it does a good job because these earphones are really loud!

Overall a good product from the price point and sound quality point of view.
Happy Shopping! :)"
528,3.0,"Connection issues is my main problem. Phone is in pocket and sound breaks up. And lag is awful in PUBG you stop walking and sound is like good second or two behind. Amazing sound quality for price. Comfortable built quality is not bad. That’s why I gave 3 stars. I am going to use it for music mainly so I am keeping it, but if you are planning to use it for gaming don’t but it. I wouldn’t recommend this. If you are using it for anything but music."
529,1.0,"Purchased it couple of months back. I learnt my lesson that if you are looking for a reasonable wireless earphone you gotta empty your pocket a bit. These mid range wireless earphones within 1000-2000 rs range is just waste of money. Because after 3 months these become useless. I bought sony mdr xb50s that cost me close to 5k that time, but i lost it. Decided to go for mid range pieces . None of them lasted for more than 3 months including this one . Bought sony mdr xb50s again ."
530,5.0,"Had purchased 02 Rockerz 255 earlier and gifted it to my colleagues, they were impressed, so during the Amazon Sale purchased another 02 and gifted them to my other colleagues, they too were happy with the products, all 04 of them are very satisfied with my choice and now they approach me for any purchases related to electronics."
531,5.0,"As I used them first time during work out session at the gym, I felt really awesome while weight training.
Sound quality is the best. Bass, voice, inbuild mic. everything is just sheer perfection. I was so confused in choosing between many options on Amazon, but I am happy that I have chosen boat over others."
532,2.0,"I used it for 2 days and I'm not really happy with this product. I purchased this to find something good in budget but it came out to be total waste. Guys if you are looking for something good in wireless, try to increase your budget a little bit higher. You will definitely find something good.
The mic is the worst. I'd give it a 1/5. There is zero noise cancellation. The person hearing your voice can barely tolerate it. Do not get this product if you are gonna use it for calling as well. You even have to use voice chat at the time of gaming and it gets really annoying for them.
The feel of product is decent. But the wire is incredibly long, feels weird while wearing it.
I have attached images, i have used an A4 sheet for size reference.
You can't wear it for longer time. The earpiece is huge and bulky. If you wear it more than an hour, it starts paining. It's not really comfortable plus it's made up of metal, it is a bit heavy.
It looses connection often or you hear distortion/breakage of sound when you are traveling. You have to keep your device very close to you otherwise the sounds start breaking. You can't even use it across the room.
It doesn't really have a good bass, the bass is okayish; 3/5. You can play around with equalizer to get a slight bass, other than that, it doesn't really have any bass considering it has 10mm drivers and that ""super extra bass"".
The battery was fine until it reached 50-60%. The rest drained within 10 minutes of usage. It charges quickly though.
I recieved a small charging cable and 2 pairs of earbuds (image)
The packaging was average. It didn't damage the product but the cover was dented a bit, it could have been better with some protection.

Sound: 3/5
Noice cancellation (sound): 4/5
Bass: 2.5/5
Comfort: 2/5
Mic: 1/5
Noice cancellation (mic): 1/5
Product feel: 4/5
Delivery: 4/5

533,5.0,"Now, im writing This as a musician.
So you could expect This review to be credible.

First of all, im in love with these earphones. These are one of the best if not the best budget bluetooth earphones in the market.
Sure there are a few flaws, but if you're not a musician/producer (anyone related to the music profession.) You'll not understand. Hell, even a few beginners wouldn't understand.

If you're looking for great sound, a great experience and a great customer service, boat is what you should go with.

However, if you're looking for perfect sound quality for something like music production or mixing, you're not going to get that in this range."
534,1.0,"Stopped working after 1 week usage, not durable and battery back up is not up to mark. no response from customer service centre. very disappointed"
535,3.0,"Review after 2 Months of usage :
I have never used branded earphones , so I was expecting the performance of this earphones to be decent in all aspects.
Some Cons first :
1. The neckband material is complete plastic and kinda hurts my back neck when I wore it directly on neck.
2. Whenever I am walking somewhat faster , and if my phone (Moto E4 Plus) is in pocket , the connectuvity abrupts some times.
3. Claiming warranty is tedious , it should have been more easier e.g. just by scanning an QR code or so.
4. The bass is okayish , not the best not bad.
5. The snapdragon chip used in this earphones claims to connect two devices simultaneously (Scatternet) but there are no clear instructions on how to do it.
6. Just few days ago I have experienced that after connection and in working normal condition, the sound from ear buds stops abruptly , and kind of weird click sound comes and even after reconnecting same issue remains.
7. My voice while in call is not really clear , I have to repeat my words while on mic.
And here are the pros that I found :
1. Battery is quite good , daily I use it for around 2 hours and I charge them once or twice a week, I literally never ran out of battery.
2. This earphones seems to have water resistance, few days ago, one of my earbud dipped into water , fortunately earphones just working fine."
536,3.0,"First of all please don't highlight my review or any comment for this product , bcze I have been a regular customer of Amazon since 2012-13 , at that time I ordered books for my study , and this account belongs to my sister account ARCHANA KUMARI (elder-housewife) , if you want to contact me through my account please go through my account details BIMLESH PRASAD -7277950100 with registered email id -bimlesh111@gmail.com....

The product was fine good while opening and tested further , rest I charged Bluetooth headphone for about 2 hrs...and then now I am listening and answering calls from my friends....

build quality is great .. Styling is also great..
I am getting 6-8 hours of battery backup with standby for 4 to 5 days... awasm battery backup..
Coming to sound quality,,, the punch of bass is just solid,, the midrange is also great,, high is little bit low,, but ok,, overall very very good sound quality... i was not accepting this type of sound quality ....also sound output is very loud...
if u have a budget of 1.5k... just go for it.... u will be happy for sure.. and in this budget point,, there are no headphone that will compete this BOAT...

A QUALITY PRODUCT FROM A QUALITY BRAND....."
538,4.0,"Well, first things first... Amazing at this cost... I have used Sennheiser, Sony, JBL... But when compared to these premium brands, Boat Rockerz 25S headset has beaten them all!!!! Why??

1. Noise Cancellation: One of the best noise cancellation headset, I've ever used... I would say, 8/10 on this parameter.. Outside noise is very much muted, but as I would have wanted, a bit outside noise is very much needed.. Safety first...

2. Sound Quality: bass is just awesome.. Just good enough that one would have wanted. Treble is also good. Sound is clear and that's what matters most.

Blootooth connectivity: It is above average, connect quite quickly.."
539,2.0,"The product was well packaged in the usual amazon bubble wrap bag although the bottom of the actual packaging was squished. But after using it for two days, i noticed that it had a lot of connectivity issues. The minute i keep my phone in my pocket, the sound starts glitching. I can't hear the music or the voice on the other end pf the call. This is disappointing since I expected this particular brand to have extremely good connectivity, at least 10m. If my phone is in clear view, like on the table, the earphones work well. But the moment i keep it in my pocket & walk, the sound starts glitching.
Pros:
1. The earphones have a good look.
2. They sit well around the neck.
3. Get connected very fast to devices.
4. I like the in built voice to indicate phone calls, powering on & off. Rather than the phone's ringtone blaring in our ears while connected to the phone, ""Incoming Call"" suffices.
5. Pop music, rock music ounds really good.
6. Very good noise cancellation.
Cons:
1. Bluetooth range is bad.
2. Not good for instrumental, classical music.
3. Bad microphone. No noise cancellation for phone calls.
4. Ears start aching after a while."
540,4.0,"One of fantastic earpiece in this price range, i got it for 899 from Great Indian Sale on Amazon.in

Sound quality is good but not best.
Bass is good.
Bluetooth connectivity is fine as i can use it anywhere in my home.
Battery is good as it gives upto 5 hours playing music or talking. (ONE PROBLEM I DETECTED IS IT WON'T SHOW YOU HOW MUCH BATTERY REMAINING) as when fully charged it shows 100% in phone suddenly after sometime it shows 80% then after sometime it's on 60% thn it can be switched off anytime but exactly it will run for 5 hours.
It gives warning of battery low at 20%

Overall good product for this price range.
It shows that it will give battery backup upto 6 hours but i find it will go upto 8 hours."
541,3.0,"Product is average.. ear buds clip sizes differ, so not holding on firmly.. slips during vigorous workouts.. Sound quality very good and decent. BUT BATTY LIFE VERY DISAPPOINTING. DISCONNECTS VERY OFTEN AFTER 1 HOUR.
SO NOT A VALUE FOR MONEY"
542,4.0,"Got it for Rs.999 at Amazon Day sale. Using it for last 2days. If compared with my old Boat 225 earphone, sound quality is almost same. But the bluetooth connectivity is really disappointed. It's getting disconnected very frequently... Even within 6-7mts. Noice cancellation is just ok. It's very light weight and very much comfortable."
543,2.0,"One of earphones not working within two months of use. Sound quality is very poor. Mic is not too good either but better than my PRIMIU APOLLO earphone which I bought later and is completely useless. In fact both Apollo & Boat blutooth earphones are useless.
I am going to throw both earphones in a dustbin and share a video later.
I will try normal wired earphones from now on."
544,5.0,"Writing after 1 months of rough use .
Only get detached the rubber cap of charging point.

Super compatible with my Samsung Grand 2 , Samsung M20 and Lenovo Lappy.

Light weight.
Super sound quality. Same as JBL as I am JBL freak . Now a days JBL is giving bad cord for headphones... this one is good in 255.
Only problem is the distance frequency is very very low.

I purchased on Rs.999/- on sale.

Better than other products as the round neck is not stiff so can listen while sleep too .

Don't think too much just go for it .. not disappoint you ."
545,4.0,"Pros: 1.light weight,
2.fast pairing for BT,
3.Comfortable fit,
4.Thundering bass!! Good for bass lovers.
5.Google assistant works perfectly.

Cons: 1.No vibration for call alert,hence can miss a call if phone is away.
2. Due to extreme Bass, sometimes vocals and fine instrument sounds get masked.
3. At full volumes, bass is very loud which if listened for long time can cause ear and headache.

But there is a solution to the problem, you can install '' Black player'', which has tones of equaliser settings.
So recommend people to use it and obviously go for boat rockerz 255, as it is value for money product!!! 😃"
546,4.0,"I bought them for around 1200 in sale
Pros :-
Awesome sound quality
Beast battery backup (Boat is lying about 6hrs backup as i have already used them for a movie and 1 hr call and 30-40 songs and overall usage for more than a day and still 60% battery left)
Support Buds for earphones do good work for holding on the earphones in ear
Voice and beats are very clear
Call quality is satisfactory
Build quality is superb.
Splash proof

Cons:-
Support earbuds start causing pain in ear for long use but thank god they are removable
Strap around the neck is good but strap goind towards buds is quite thin. Handle with care
Small range as it is 4.1 Bluetooth with less than 10m coverage"
547,5.0,"Great battery standby is the 1st thing i would mention, 2nd would be awesome quality sound. Pretty loud when u need it and not overwhelming at the same time. Great bass and surround effects. This is my second purchase of boat rockerz 255 and am currently using both of em as i am on calls and music most of the time. Still it gives more than 8 hours standby.
Great buy. Very much recommended. Also i have claimed warranty from boat and got a replacement so i can say the warranty claim they make works. GO FOR IT."
548,4.0,"Good if you are in <₹1500.. sound wuality is not superb but it cant be registered as bad. Is good but not matchable with jbl. Higher frequencies are missing and baas is not enough powerful. Actually it is serving my requirements completely as off watching movies and series. For enthuastic music listeners, this is not recommended but for routine use its is good. Battery life is for whole day with normal calls and 6-8 hour movies. Product looks sturdy and durable. Connects automatically when paired with a device earlier, sometime you have to manipulate in your ear for fitting, ear bud looks cheap though, extra 2 set of earbud are available in the box along with small usb cable"
549,5.0,"It has amazing sound quality bass is superb and punchy.
Pros
1. Earbuds seals the ears and cancels the outdoor noise it fits properly and stays in ear for longer time.
2. The battery backup is good about 6-7 hr of playback and about more than full day standby.
3. Amazing sound quality
Cons
1. Bluetooth connectivity is not so good you can feel the desortion in sound when phone is in another room. Also i have experienced signal drop in open areas when phone is in pocket.
2. LATENCY IS BAD its not a good product to play games and watch movies and series you will have to adjust the audio delay everytime and still you will face half second latency.

This is the only issue overall product is awesome"
550,4.0,"BoAt rockerz. Very good at reasonable price Bluetooth earphone. Got it at Prime sale at Rs 999/-.

Pros.
Bass is good.
Fits properly inside the ears.

Cons.
Pre configured voice that come while connecting / Disconnecting, or incoming call is not clear. May be bcoz of Male voice
😜"
551,5.0,"Never used a boAt product before this one, but boy was i impressed by the quality of this thing....

BASS 9/10
Mids 9/10
highs 8/10
Battery performance 9-10 hours on full charge (also has a feature where 10 mins of charge will give you 35mins worth of battery)...
BT range 7-10m depending upon obstacles between this and the phone
comfort 8/10 ....(those plasticy(silicone actually) things protruding from the might feel a bit uncomfortable at first)

cons: 1) has a irritating indicator for low battery which i presume goes off about 4-5 times....at 10% first then every drop in percentage after 5% will have you hearing ""oops battery is getting low"" or a similar message
2) The charging port is concealed in an awkard way...although its durable but the cover is kinda obtrusive
3) i recommend not using a power/fast/turbo charger (or whatever they call it these days) if you want to see them live longer than a month.....110mAH battery Li-On battery would def not like that [i charge mine using my laptop USB port.....sometimes i have charged it using my phone too 3% drain for a full charge EPIC for travelling]
i have used many wired earphones before this so having a comparison between them seems stupid but it does well in competing with the sennheiser cx 180, jbl C200Si and it even outperforms the sony MDR-Ex150ap in terms of sound quality...
also getting it around for 1400 seems like the best price ...anything higher and i would save up for sumtin else

tl;dr if this fits your budget then go for it without thinking"
552,1.0,"Writing this after 4 months of usage. Not any expert on earphones, just a layman trying to get a VFM Bluetooth headphones with some nice audio quality. No doubt boat rockerzz dissapoints to the core. The built quality is really bad one of the edges is already coming off. The battery caught and the coating started pelling off. The Bluetooth connectivity is also bad. There are gaps in the connectivity even when the phone is in my pocket.
The only saving Grace is the bass in the audio.

Bluetooth connectivity - 2/10
Build quality - 1/10
Audio quality - 6/10
Value for money - not at all"
553,5.0,"length of its both wires are frustrated as too lengthy and not comfortable at all, when you fix the buds in ears not hearing any outside sounds clearly...
Also hurting eqrs. Other than above
Battery capacity and Bluetooth range & built quality r good...
Inspite of my review,
I loved the warranty of the product
My product's right bud wasn't work for a while I have opted for claiming warranty, they were accepted my warranty and replaced with another piece within 20 days...

555,3.0,"Its good for listening music or watching videos, but for calling purpose sound its JUST OKAY.
Battery life is Okay not Good.
I am using them from last 3 months and right side ear phone is not working.
I tried to contact supplier for warranty claims but its not easy to contact him even AMAZON's customer support is not helpful. Number they have given is not going through.
I paid around 1500/- and now they are not working properly :("
556,1.0,"I was so excited when I purchased this Bluetooth headset. But too much dissapointed when I used. Volume is very low while listening, not up to mark and no bass at all in any song. Totally dissapointed, returned back. Not recommend for music lovers at all. Even in call , caller volume is also very low."
557,1.0,"I return this and give 1 star due to this points.
1. Sound quality is not good, 3/10
2. Bass is too much limited, 1/10
3. Overall sound loudness is low, 3/10
4. If I adjust equalizer in my mobile iske speaker bhrraate he.

I not feel good sound so I return.
225 is much much much batter from 255"
558,4.0,"I brought this headphone compared to nothing. So previously i didn't have any Bluetooth headset. What i find good about this product is that 1. Its very light weight, very easy to carry while wearing 2. The quality of the chord is great, it can't damage easily 3. The sound quality is awesome and the best part is the noise cancellation which works completely great. Its takes only few minutes to get charged while plays for hours which is very great.
Now after using this for about one month the problem i have found is with the Bluetooth connection, sometime might face problem with lagging while listening.
But this problem you will feel rarely like in a day 4-5 times.
Apart from that, this is a great product to buy."
559,3.0,"Everything about the earphones are really good. But jus that even the best products has the cons to it! So first off...,
The sound Quality it's flawless and buttery smooth... But..! In an immerse content called the ""Extra Boost"" they've pumped up the Bass alone!? Where's the original bit of the song Ya'll!? 😑 The bass is so dominant that the original bit of the song isn't present.

Secondly.., if your are frequent user of the earphones.. I highly recommend not to go for it. After my extensive usage for about a week I found that the Backup charge in the device is horrible... And the most irritating thing is that it powers off at 20% (What the Heck) that's a true example of a poor Build. The battery doesn't even last for 3-4 Hrs of continuous playing.. But if your a timely user then this device might a perfect fit!"
560,5.0,Bass is on heavy side battery back up is good I get close to 7 hours with half volume the grip on the earphones are really getting good overall I see there should be a bit more balance of treble and bass on the headphones I Brought these on sale for 999 which is awesome price go for it
561,1.0,"What I liked:
Battery life - 7 to 8 hours of continuous music (9/10)
Music quality - good (7/10)
Range- 8±4 m

Review after using it 6 months:
Left side - stopped working
Right side- working with reduced volume
# earphone slips out of ear while even walking
# the parts of the earphones that keep it tight to ears have lost bcoz after some time those became loose.
# lost 2 earlobes already because of looseness.
# presently I'm not using this headphone."
562,4.0,"Actually a product worth buying.. I have mostly been a fan of quality products than brand names.. Boat has come up with a product that does just everything it is supposed to do.. I got it for under 1k on one of the sale days and that's why it's even more of a satisfying buy.. my views on this after using my Boat Rockers for almost over a month extensively..
1. Sound is quite good..bass is quite good for regular use (I mostly listen to Psychedelic, Techno and Rock, performs genuinely on all the genres)

2. Lightweight - I have slept wearing it twice, never realised..!!

3. Good battery life- goes on easily for 6-7 hours with one charge..(mix of usage and standby)

4. Love the color- I have a red and black colour one..looks super classy..

5.noise cancellation is good. Blocks out pretty much all of the ambient sound even in the middle of noisy surroundings..

All in all..I am happy I waited a long time to buy a genuine wireless earphone and Boat Rockers made it worth the wait..

Cheers team Boat..!!"
563,5.0,hi the sound quality is very good and not truly impressive at this price. The passive noise cancellation has almost no effect since the cushioning of ear plugs into ear would almost suppress all the noise. There are extra earplugs at variable sizes given to us. And other than this there is no other accessories provided.
564,5.0,"The product is amazing when it comes to sound quality and the material used in the making.

It works decently at it's low pricing but the pannel of buttons on the headphones have stopped responding which as caused the Mic to not work as well.

But still the songs play well with any issues....."
565,5.0,"Writing this review after several months of using it. This is a great product, very good bass, excellent noise cancellation and the best part is battery back up, it gets full charge in just 45 mins max and you can use it for more than 7 hours, approx. I am very happy with this product. Boat is definitely in the market for something big as it's providing awesome products at very affordable price."
566,4.0,"great in most aspects( only for music lovers )
bass-9/10
bass is ultimate if u r a bass lover than it's for u.
PUBG player note:-
not recommended for playing games for it has sound lag, which most of this budget earphones give.
If want ear or headphones for gaming than this is not for u.
sound quality-8/10
noise cancellation 7/10
the main part of noise cancellation is that it could cancel most noise like people's voice,traffic etc. but not useful against sharp noises i.e. sound of all same frequency .
bluetooth connectivity-5/10
very poor u an even go even 8m away but description shows 10m.
overall 7.25/10
BUT still great in budget
got this for 999/- in GIF"
567,1.0,I am facing problems with mine one...i dont know why bt the left earpeice stops working automatically sometimes...i jst ordered for replacement...bt now m afraid...d if d replacemt product works d same way....den my 1500 rupees will be a loss...if any of you face the same...please let me know
568,5.0,"Boat's signature sound quality - fantastic.
I wouldn't depend too much on noise cancellation - not too much.
Pretty comfortable but I had to take out the extended rubber hooks (or whatever you call it) from the earpieces and it was great then.
Would have preferred a shorted cable but it's not a deal breaker.
Regular use sweat over ears or at the neck does no harm, but I have been skeptical to try in the rains."
569,2.0,Except the looks and battery backup i think nothing is good. Sound is of below average quality...after listening to sony i applied this and i could not fathom why such good ratings..rather try out philips/sony wired earphones guys..could not return as packaging was thrown by maid..😪
570,1.0,"Cons:
~ Quality of plastic is cheap for the price.
~ Cable that goes around the neck is very stiff and uncomfortable to wear.
~ Ear bud rubber is slippery and even the bud with does not fit properly.
~ Multifunction buttons provided in the right side tag is hard to press does not provide proper haptic feedback.
~ Length of the cable is longer than the required size and makes sure that the mic stays away from your mouth so that during calls people can hardly hear you.
~ -200% noise cancellation, when you are on a call, the receiver can hear the noise of a motorcycle that is 1km away from you. It actually absorbs the noise better than the users voice.
~ For multifunction keys dedicated to power on/off, toggle previous/next and to enable Google assistant, the time defined for long press is so long that it's frustrating everytime when you want to turn off your device.
Pros:
* Good sound quality
* Voiceover feedback on key press actions are highly intuitive."
571,1.0,"Durability : Left ear phone has stopped working !!
This is within 25 days of buying the product. Suggest not to buy this product ."
572,2.0,"The battery drains real fast, exhausted in 1.5 hours. Unlike other headphones, it still keeps running even when the earbuds are locked with each other. And there's often this disturbance during calls and I have to switch to earpiece.

Sound quality is decent so alright for listening to music but there's still the battery issue."
573,1.0,What a waste product. There is no concept of noise cancellation except your voice each n every outsider sound u can hear in this headphone. The main purpose to buy this product is to avoid that helmet m phone fasa k phone pe baat krna but guess what when u use this headphone while driving u can hear only altu faltu sound but not that person voice. Infact it hurts your ears too when your wear helmet over this. Seriously after using 2 to 3 months I am writing this review and it really sucks. I am a boat lover person but this product seriously disappointed me alot.
574,1.0,"Sound Quality, Noise Cancellation and Bluetooth Connectivity is good enough in this budget. But the mic went bad within 5months of purchase. Even one side earphone stopped working. But the main problem is that their customer service is hardly ever reachable if you face an issue. They pick up the earphones for service by a courier and never responded again. It's been 2 weeks already since I sent them my bluetooth earphones but I am yet to get a reply, leave alone getting my earphones. As far as I know this is a similar case like another brand called 'House of Marley'. 'Boat' Brand is very bad in their customer service response. This is a major drawback for an upcoming brand since if customer service team is careless then buying a 'Boat' brand product is as risky as buying any other non branded product."
575,5.0,"This is a very convenient and easy to use earphones. I had no issues with connectivity or battery as they are both good and reliable. The sound leans heavily on the bass side of things. For bass heads who like loud earphones, this is perfect. For people who want a more neutral sounding earphones, look elsewhere"
576,3.0,"Hi,

This is a average quality headset. But in this price range I would say it is a good buy for sure.
Pros:
1. Very good battery backup. Last 6-7 hours on a average use.
2. Build quality is good. Fit perfectly to the ears.
3. Connects two device at a time. Connects easily.
4. Less charging time.
5. Very comfortable to wear.

Cons:
1. Sound quality is average. Don't expect much. You have to use equaliser otherwise no use.
2. Call quality is not good. It could be better
3. Connectivity issue if your mobile device is far from your headaet, even while your mobile device in pocket, sometime you will observe connectivity issue.

Verdict- Well if you are a great music lover and if you are looking for a headset which has great sound quality than this is not a ideal device for you. However, if you want to use this device casually on a day to day basis like join meetings or gym etc than this a most value for money device

Thanks,
Sourav"
577,4.0,"Likes:
1. Good sound quality with great bass effect.
2. Good noise cancelling but no knob to adjust the level of cancellation.
3. Fast charging time.
4. Lots of different sized earpieces for different ear types.

Dislikes:
1. Poor build quality.
2. Feels fragile.
3. Battery backup is not good and you might need to charge it daily.
4. Bluetooth range is poor.

Overall, at this price the product delivers pretty decent sound quality and is a must grab for anyone looking for not so expensive neck stereo earphones."
578,4.0,"Bought during the festival sales for 800, 5 Star for pricing and 1 day delivery.
Pros:
1. Above average sound quality
2. Bluetooth connectivity is trouble free.
3. Ergonomics are good
4. Superior build quality

Cons:
1. Bluetooth range is low
2. Noise heard for other person on call
3. Sound distortion at high volume

My verdict it's an absolute buy if you get it under 1000 Rs deals."
579,4.0,Bang for the buck. Only improvement i would suggest is a longer battery life. It lasts only for couple of hours of usage. And after 9 months of usage it is now broken. The right channel doesn't have a voice now. Stays connected in idle state for a day though. But if we use it continuously it doesn't last longer than max 2.5 hours.
580,4.0,"Bass is high, ideal for hip hop music, but if u r into instrumentals and sad slow songs you'll feel it a nuisance and noise. Connectivity was good with my OnePlus 5, built quality looks long lasting, light weight but the wire is too long, beats the whole idea of a wireless headset."
581,5.0,I was first confused to order as I was also surrounded with people using the same device. Then I order one & it's pretty much descent in this price point. Well I ordered this while the GIF sale was happening & I spent just Rs. 999/- for this product. Now I am using this from last 5 days. Music was not only my concern but while calling i needed a clear voice cancelling device & surprisingly it turned out to be an amazing device. You can buy this if you have a use for both music & voice calling. Thanks!
582,1.0,"Got it for 999 during a flash sale.
The left earphone stopped working properly within a week. Got it replaced.. Thanks to amazon.
The replacement is even worse. The battery dies down within 2 hrs of usage. And to top it off, the boat support is being handled by idiots who say that battery damage isn't covered under warranty. Even when i mentioned this is a new earphone hardly used for a week, the answer is same.
So just stay away from boat products however lucrative the deal might be."
583,2.0,"The boat wireless/bluetooth connectivity has a serious issue. I was using boat wired headphones and it worked well for me. But in wireless section boat does not justify its presence.
The wirelss headphons tends to disconnect intermittently after few minutes and ruin the experience. Not worth it guys."
584,3.0,"Delivery service is worst. I was waiting for my order since morning as it was to deliver on Wednesday for God sake I didnot receive any call, when I checked in the app it showed me product is out for delivery. I tried to call the Amazon delivery number since morning, call rings n get disconnected. It was 7 in the evening, I called the number again call connected n delivery guy stated he will come in 2 hours. I was angry like anything, is that a tym to deliver the product ? I said to him I need the product urgently as I had to go out, however it got delivered at 8.30.
Coming to the product it is good for the people who are looking for Bass. We cannot hear the words clearly, Bass is too high some times and it blocks ur ears completely cannot hear the sounds around you. Felt dangerous while driving n other situations. Battery will last upto 6 to 7 hrs when fully charged. However I bought it at discount for 899/- it is good at this price range."
585,3.0," Bass is extremely good. No doubt. mic clarity is very poor, especially during outside. Mic noise cancelation is not effective. Ear buds are comfort enough and completely conceals the ears so during driving you should use only one side, otherwise you cannot hear the other vehicles horns etc., After usage for some long time of 1hr or so it pains in the ears. Battery back up is 4 to 5hrs hardly. Please be careful that once battery charge comes down to 20%, it switches off...bluetooth connectivity range is very short."
586,3.0,"The mic is horrible. You can't use them for calling. The person on other end could hear the slightest background noise like the fan or an airplane passing by. The mics don't have noise cancellation. It's pretty horrible that I had to return it.

Without the calling function working fine it is not value for money. The sound quality is great if you want to use it just for listening to music. Battery life is decent, not the best available in the price range.

Bluetooth connectivity is below average as I could hear glitches and breaks even if I keep my phone in the pocket."
587,5.0,I like the design of the headset. The best part of headset is sound the movement just turn it on i feel like i was in heaven and the beats were so good very can abel to listen each other and evry instrument which was played in the headset it was crystal Clear and i recommended this is one of the fantastic product and paisa vasool product.. please go for it...
588,1.0,"Didnt fit my expectations,sound quality is good but battery backup is pathetic never lasted more than half an hour on 100 % charge,moreover the range too isnt good.doesnt work for running as the fitting isnt great .packaging too was pathetic it had dust inside the package.

Stopped working within two weeks,wareanty isnt smooth too,jun 14 se complaint daali hai no response.wasted my money"
589,4.0,"It's been only one day so I can't rate it 5 star as I need to see how long it will last. From the first feel it seems to be a reasonable product.
I was under the impression that the neck band is made up of the wire itself but it's a semi-soft material which looks ok and doesn't cause discomfort. Buds hold well into the ears."
590,2.0,"Sound Quality
whomever used boat 225 in-ears headphones can understand better. If you have both 225 nd rockerz 255, you can compare the sound quality at the high volume and the clarity of songs. 225 was far better in that..
And the guidelines are there only for how to switch on the Bluetooth and not clear for how to switch it off.
Distance
It was surely dislike for any one, if your mobile was in the next room then it was disconnecting again.
Charging
Draining fast for continues usage, need to charge it more times. And it was not showing clearly indication of charging bar in mobile. Showing it rarely.
Light Indication
It was not clear at all. It is showing a mixed colours.
Mic
Without holding it you can't talk properly. It was a dear distance to use.
And if you continuously keep them in ears it will be paining.
Please never don't buy it from Appario seller. Better to buy from another seller. Even we can't return the product for lifetime.."
591,5.0,"I was nervous while purchasing this earphone based on all reviews i read. but im so happy that i purchased it.
Its too good
1) sound is too good.
2) fits perfectly in ears, as it provide three ear buds with different size.
3) bass is so good.
4) EDM music lover will love it.
5) Can connect two device at a time.

problems :
1) Bluetooth connectivity problem you may face initially, but if you switch off earphone and mbl bluetooth, and again on it it will work. Once it connects your device you wont face connectivity problem.

Customer service:
1) Really happy to say that i had issue regarding bluetooth connectivity, after raising complaint i got fast reply from boat people, even though issue was resolved, i was keep getting calls from baot people for issue.

2) you can replace item within no time, service is too good

ps: i have never written this much big review for any product."
592,3.0,"Went for this as I have previously used boat handphones. But this product disappointed me. The headphone tip broke within 1 month of use.

Got this for Rs.900 in the sale.

Pros:

1.Bluetooth connectivity issue. If kept in lower jean pocket, sometimes the connectivity drops and its very irritating.
2. Poor Quality.
3. The headphone tip easily breaks due to poor design."
593,4.0,"Review after 3 months of purchase;
Bluetooth range is awesome
And the mic quality is quite good, it is good for calls, sometimes you can't even hear voices when on-calls , make sure that you're near to your device and you have better connection and try disconnecting and reconnecting. even if it doesn't work better throw them to garbage😂😂 (garbage list:it's useful for a programmer)
Rich in bass. But the ear holding tip-makes you uncomfortable as you wear it for a long period of time. As I've removed Just because it was so annoying. And....
Sounds great, sound quality is equal to Sony MdR-xb55AP-ExtraBass."

●The sound quality is amazing for a ear set..
●The entire wire is flexible so even if you sleep with it it won't be a problem.

● Rest everything till now is good
Cons:
●although they provide extra ear plugs but it also has a extra support that gets into your external ear ( pinna) and I lost one of them.It usually gets loose when you adjust your ear sets . Now difficult to set one ear plus while running other wise while doing less activity it still retains in."
597,4.0,"Was good while it lasted.... three months down the line, one side earphones stopped working (no physical damage or misuse)... now I am trying to contact BOAT customer support for a replacement under warranty, but the support page on their website just does not load/exist...! Will update if and when I can get through to them..."
598,1.0,"Horrible product with mic issues on call. The customer service is even worse. The customet service number is unavailable for last 5 days. There has been no update on the replacement of the headphone. They picked up the product the next day with no replacement or any update on when the product will be replaced. It has been 10 days that I am trying to get in touch with the customer service but the number is either unavailable or the office is closed.
The sound quality is ok but the bluetooth connectivity and on-call mic is not working at all."
599,4.0,"i am using this product from last 2 month and i will telll you about its pros and cons
💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛
Pros:

1. Flexible

2. Less in weight

3. Battery backup is good about 6 - 7 hrs listen in 60-80% volume

4. Build quality is also good and also used during exercise

5. Ear bud support which is very goood i think..

💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛

cons :

1. Battery backup reduced to 3 -4 hrs when used in full volume

2. Sound quality is not that good treble is more and bass is less u cna feel that in high volume"
600,3.0,"The headphones are justified for the price that they are available. I am using these since 15 days now and haven't noticed any major drawback, except that the Bluetooth keeps disconnecting if you are using it while on bike. Some modulations are noticed then. Also, after connecting to a laptop if tried to connect to the cellphone it does not auto connect. Otherwise and sound quality is good for a normal usage. Battery life is also decent around 4-5 hours of constant use."
601,5.0,"Very good sound quality. It is perfect for sports and also other purposes.
Very good bass (if bass is not there download app bass booster you will get it)
Noise cancelation is good
It is given that battery backup of 6 hours
But after i used it, i came to know that it can give a battery back up of 6 hours and more"
602,5.0,"Above expectation, excellent sound quality and the battery life is just incredible, one charge easily lasts you around mote than 5 days with normal uses (only music while traveling) and 6-8 hrs in one go if you using it continuously. The durability is nice and the magnetic feature really comes handy when not in use. Light weight very negligible weight and not noticeable when around neck, but sometimes this may result of loosing it and not suitable for bike ride (if riding at high speed)."
603,5.0,"First, let me mention that I got this product at Rs 999 during sale. The build of the product is average and the magnet holding the two earpieces is average. When it comes to sound quality, these are perfect for listening songs and movies in surround sound. However, the only area that the product lacks is the microphone's performance on a call. You'll often hear the other party complaining that they can't hear you, instead the background noise takes centrestage. So avoid using them for calling in busy, noisy areas, otherwise they work fine in quiet environments. Hope the product price drops to 1000 Rs mark permanently."
604,2.0,"My review after using it for a 20 mins. My ears are paining... Its not BASS actually, its like DJ LOUD SPEAKER... As I'm using of Sony Extra-bass wired headset and Apple, this is nothing compared to them. Just for the sake of Wireless headset, you can ahead. I didn't checked call clarity on it."
605,1.0,Biggest mistake to buy such kind of product. Boat products can never be trusted. These products have life equivalent to their warranty period or sometimes much lower than that. If u want to waste your money for a product that has shelf life of 6 months u can go for this stupid product. I purchased it in June last year and its battery life got damaged within 5 months. I replaced the product from the service centre which is quite far from my home and again it got damaged with similar issue within 2 days. Boat should stop making such garbage products. Beware of this trash is you value your money. Either go for a reputed brand which might cost more but have a good shelf life.
606,4.0,"Boat Rockerz..
1. Noice cancellation 4/5
2. Bluetooth Connectivity 4/5
3. Battery Backup 5/5
4. Call Connectivity 4/5
And most important one
5. Music/Songs clarity..4/5..
If you install Bass Booster App and do the settings as done by me then you will get surprised by the sound output.
Hence I advice to those whose main purpose of buying this earphone is to listen music, to install Bass Booster App with the equalizer settings and do the settings according to your needs which will improve sound output to the great extent..Thanks
But that app only supports some of the music players..thankfully Google play is supported by the app.."
607,4.0,"I have been using this product since early feb and it still works like a peach. The sound quality is brilliant. Never experienced a break in the Bluetooth sync. No sound delay while watching videos and the battery life is excellent too.. I just have one complaint, well actually its faced by the people who i talk to over the phone. Whenever I use this product to talk over the phone, they always complain about too much background disturbance. It does not cancel out the background sound of others talking around you. Rather their voices gets amplified and I have to immediately stop using it. I validated this by being on the receiving end and the complains definitely is genuine. I think this is the only issue which restricts it from being the ultimate product."
608,4.0,I have purchased these headphones for my brother and he is currently using it but when I used these earphones I found that the bass is not that much good it is ok ok for listening songs on the go but if you are expecting something very powerful or something appreciable it is not in that League although it is quite comfortable to wear but you have to compromise the quality of song with the comfort..... that's what I feel.... show my birth date is if you want to have a comfort of wearing light earphones or headphones then it is a good bye but if you wish to have something good for listening to I would not suggest it !!
609,2.0,"There's no Bluetooth connectivity at all, even if you move 2-3 metres it loses the connectivity, and also if you are walking, there's the connectivity problem. There's no noise cancellation, if you are in a busy place, the other end person won't be able to hear you properly. Only good thing about this phone is the sound quality."
610,1.0,I have ordered this for 3 times. Only once I have received good one. Other two times I have received with open box and missing attachments. Once I returned also and ordered new one but again I have received with tempered box.
611,4.0,"I have been using it for the past 2 months and seemed like a good time to review it now. Firstly, the headphones are very trendy and not at all cumbersome. The magnets behind the earphones help to keep them untangled. The in ear design cancels all noise and keeps the music clean. The music urself is very pleasurable as the bass and treble keeps the perfect balance and gives u an wonderful experience. Connection range is around 100metres and works well with call as well."
612,5.0,Good Headphone for music lover but if you buy it for watching movie then go for another option. Bass is really good which makes your music experience better but you will miss lower tone and mid tone when watching movies. Low vocal and high bass suffer you in movie experience. When we need high vocal and low base at movie. Its high base and instrumental tone suppress the vocal of movie.. Battery backup is good. You can get 6-7 hours battery backup easily and takes 1.5 hours full charge.
613,4.0,"I didnt want to buy. But I saw a lot of reviews and feedback about this earphones. So i finally I ordered and trust me I didnt regret. Awesome sound quality with high bass. People who like more bass definitely u shoukd go for it. Battery back up is also good. If u r sports person the hooks on earphones does it work fabulously. It dont allow to come out of ur ears.
Cons:
1. Bluetooth range should have been more
2. Battery back up should have been more."
614,3.0,"The sound quality is good, No connectivity issues as well. connects swiftly to phone. One of the major issue is the noise cancellation, often on calls people tell me that there is lot of noise around. this is the major flaw with this.
Unless u are in a quiet place else its good."
615,4.0,"I purchased it after returning one basic sports bluetooth headphone.(Not sure if I mention the brand) , it would violate Amazon's policies. Overall it is very good , and only rant is sound quality. Sound quality is average. Battery life is good . No significant sound drops. I got it at 999 /- which was a deal to steal."
616,5.0,"Purchased this on may 2019. Good sound quality and clarity.
One of the speakers stopped working after usage for around 6 months.

What amazed me was the prompt response and service i received from the customer care/support team at imagine marketing india pvt ltd. after arranging for a pickup on mY product,today on 25th february 2020,i received a replacement unit completely free of cost

Whoever is reading this comment, i highly recommend you to purchase this as the after sales service was way beyond satisfactory.

618,3.0,"After 3 months usage :
The product is not so good as it looks.
Pros :
Holds charge for long time.
Connectivity is quick.
Cons:
Not comfortable fit.
Sound distortion when used in calls.
Not so great sound quality
Overall i regret spending 1.5 k for it."
619,1.0,"Worst experience, in few months use I was so obsessed with the quality and use of the headset but after few months i got issues with wired disconnect issues and one earpiece got damanged, then after registering complaint, I got repaired even after asking for replacement, then within 3mnth again gpt same issues, this time when I asked for registering complaint, the service centre asked me to visit the centre cox there is no online pickup in metro cities, another option he gave for parceling the same to mumbai ofc on my charge, I don't know what is the use of replacement and warranty then? Although 3mnths left in warranty over period, and second time issues and worst customer service.
I would never recommend anyone in future."
620,5.0,"Guys hold your breath...I have just received the packaging from Amazon and after a couple of minutes I unpacked it and tried this new boat earphone.Believe me guys , well let me begin with the initials first.

1. Here I would like to give amazon 100percent Mark's for packaging .It was so well packed and well received . Great job amazon

2. Authenticity of product : I do not have any efficacy on the authentication of this product Guys just at a blink of your eye, you know it's original.

3. Sound quality: awesome and coming

4. Noise cancellation : I can't deduct any Mark's here although it does not provide that high end noise cancellations because guys these are not the noise cancellation earphones, pay some extra bucks and get the sony earphones if you want noise cancellation.

."
621,3.0,"I'm not happy that boat made these sub par headphones. They sound quality feels tinny. And the build quality was bad. The rubber casing came loose on one end after a month of use and i use it with the wire dangling out of the casing now. Not happy with this purchase. Then again, they didnt cost too much."
622,4.0,"Sound quality is as you expect from this price, bass is heavy which some might like, build is good and looks durable, there’s no noise cancellation for sure and you can’t expect that at this price. Connects easily to any device and you can connect 2 devices simultaneously"
623,1.0,In 2 months surrounding issue...1 side is totally damaged..And not working...Want to replace...Plzz help
624,5.0,"Hi,
Good sound quality at this price range. I am using it just recently and has already noticed that build is not so good, one of the biggest flaws actually. Second problem I faced is that the wire is too long, hence lookwise it looks bit shabby and also it keeps calling from the ear. Here again the earbuds design not so good to add it to the easily falling off from the ear. Who likes it! Apart from this boat always provides satisfactory listening experience at cheaper rates. I would love to see it working even after one year even after so many build flaws, after all if the product is rough and tough at affordable rates, all this flaws can be ignored.

Thanks!"
625,1.0,Stopped working after 1 month
626,1.0,"The worst quality earphones i have ever used. I replaced a defective first one, got a more defective second one. The ear piece is seperated from the hub. I think this is the most common defect and because of worst built quality. My return request is just ignored by Amazon. No one came to pick up the item and it was showing ""refund would be initiated after successful return of item"". So no pick up by them, no refund. Very disappointed for the first time with Amazon. I feel Amazon is best and rely on their products and return policies. But it's not a smooth experience for me."
627,3.0,"The pity is that everything about these earphones are great, starting from the sound quality, the technology/user-friendliness, and even the instructions. But I don't know which genius came up with the earbud designs. They hurt a lot! Unless you insert them deep in your ears you won't really be able to get them to stay on. Inevitably after about 15 minutes of usage, your ears will ache. Therefore even though its a perfectly fine product in all other ways, its not very usable. A great pity."
628,4.0,"I like this headset
Battery lasts longer 5-6 hours approx
Quality of sound is good
Connects easily
Light weight
Build quality good

It pains in the ear after 15-30 mins of usage its little uncomfortable even after changing the buds size."
629,4.0,"It's been couple of months since I purchased this headphones. The quality of sound is good. A competitive product at this price range. However I see few niggles in the Bluetooth connectivity. When songs keep streaming from mobile device continuously, there is slight interruptions in between breaking the seamless play.. The interruptions are more frequent when you touch the mobile device by hand"
630,3.0,"I have few pros and cons. Don't know what others are reviewing.

Pros:
+ Good battery life
+ Good bass
+ Good sound quality for musics

Cons:
- Bad quality of sound for other on voice call
- voice assistant not working
- while connecting two phones very bad music voice sometimes cutting sounds in-between"
631,2.0,"After using 6 months this bluetooth m writing this review,
Pros.
It's cheaper than its competitors
Has 3hrs battery backup for music
For calls it lasts half day on avg.
Cons
Connectivity with xiomi/ Samsung phones is an serious issue, I have xiomi note 6 pro and samsung M30s and Note 10 this device has issue with all devices but it works well with samsung tablets."
632,2.0,"No doubt , it's long last till 5.5 hours... And charge very fast in an hour . But the thing is it's inbuilt quality is not so much good. Mine right ear peice got stop working in one and half month only. May be due to problem in my earphone set. But the bass is too high and the treble is quite low it can't be used for daily hearing it's a good for calling but the mic is in left string , so it must as much near to Ur mouth other wise other person next to phone can't hear Ur voice. And remember it's a not good daily . I loved its battery and charging and I would rate 6/10 for music , 8/10 for charging , 9/10 for bass , 10/10 for battery backup , 5/10 for treble , 7/10 for calling , its my review after using it for a quite one and a half month"
633,5.0,"To those who doesn't get to know the realistic review about this product.

I've been using it for 2 days and understood the sound quality. And i F-u-kin love these earphones.

Noise Cancellation is very good. You can't hear noises until you try to hear them.

Comfortability. You can't listen for a longer period of time. It will start paining after 20 mins. These were not comfortable until i removed the wings. And i had some old eartips which i am using right now. These are more comfortable to me. And now i can listen to 4 hours straight without paining.

Battery life is excellent. Used for 2 days and battery percentage dropped from 100 to 40%.

Now the Sound Quality.

Mids are average. Won't miss any sound.

Highs (treble or vocals) is not up to the mark. BUT, If you adjust the equaliser settings then you can make it sounds so amazing.

Lows (bass) is SO POWERFUL. Rockerz 255 was only made for the bass lovers i guess. Their only focus was on the bass. These earphones have extra bass.
(i am saying this so many times because it literally has so much bass)
The people who are saying that it would have been better if it had more bass are stupid as fun.

I have used some high and mid end earphones like Sony Mdr xb55 with extra bass, Jbl T110 and Oneplus Bullets.

At first when i heard, i thought i made a mistake by purchasing these Earphones but when i equalised it. I made it sounds like some high end earphones. And i am very happy with the purchase now.

You will only like this if you didn't have an high end earphones. But if you have never heard an high end earphones and wants some eargasm then i must say that you should go with the product. You'll be happy with the purchase and dont forget to equalise."
634,1.0,Don't buy these type of products seriously. Recently I bought this boat rockerz bluetooth headphones it had worked very nice for 1 week only afterwards a lot of disturbance while talking in a phone for that i need to replace it. Again I got these disturbance problem so i decided better to return the product and don't waste of my time and my money. That's y I suggest to you my dear friends don't waste ur money don't buy these products
635,3.0,The sound is average not that good as compared to JBL and some other great brands. The bass is more but treble is less. If u travel on a bike or cycle and wind is blowing at a higher speed then there is lag in Bluetooth connection. Overall good at the price of 999. If you want great quality sound go for JBL or boult or Bose.
636,3.0,"I would say at this price (999 Rs.) it's a must buy product.

Pros - 1. Bluetooth connectivity is really good, I kept my phone at bedroom and was at hall and the sound was clear.

2. Mic and noise cancellation working really fine.
3. Flexible and durable.
4. Sweat Proof.

Cons.

The only con is that it's sound quality was damn good in iPhone but in Android it's quite normal like other basic headphones. As I have iPhone 7 and Android phone, I prefer to listen to songs by connecting with iPhone as it is giving good support to this headset."
637,2.0,"I have been using the earphones for a while now. The main demerit is the battery , you have to charge it every now and then as it doesn't give good backup. The sound for bass intensive raps / hip hop tracks is not good. You can hear clear distortions and it isn't pleasant at all. Ironically, the noise cancellation doesn't work in this case. If you want an example , listen to Kendrick Lamar - Loyalty with the earphones and you can feel the clear difference.

The most annoying thing about this is the bluetooth range and connectivity. It disrupts every now and then and the sound keeps tearing until you disconnect and re-pair with your device again.

Overall , a very bad experience ."
638,1.0,Purchased in April 19 and after after 6 mths product isn't working. Initially the product performance was good like Bluetooth connectivity and battery life but after 6 mths connection failure is frequent and finally no sound in both the earphones. My view at this point is product is overpriced and not that durable. Let's see what response I will be getting at service center as it's still under warranty.
639,4.0,"Pros:
1. Impressive bluetooth range even with physical blockers in between
2. Sound quality is satisfactory
3. No issue with sweat
4. Fits well in ear

Cons:
1. Poor battery life. You need to charge every 2-3 days even with just 1 hour of usage. Long charging duration
2. Connecting wires a bit longer thus look odd while wearing them in gym"
640,4.0,"*Writing the review after 1 week of use.
Product is good, the brand #Boat you can trust it. Sound is amazing and #Bass for which i was excited is good enough. May be for some of you bass can be a problem but guys for a price of this plus wireless you can't expect more. Also this product is long lasting. Things i liked about this-
1. design
2. Bass
3. Magnet
4. It's durability"
641,5.0,"Wow......i say, just BOOM boom....
Bass......just awesome......DEEP bast is very very good....
I used jbl bt160 which cost 2200rs...
But this is worth buying....at Amazon in just 899rs....
What a sound yaar...paisa vasul....
Battery backup also nice......i recommended for this"
642,3.0,The quality of the product was overall good but it's been just 2months of use and already one ear has stopped working. If u really don't want to waste money then don't buy this product becoz by 2 to 3 months you'll also face the same problem. And the waranty is just for name sake as u can't get it fixed anyhow. Think before spending so much. If the product works in good condition only for 2 months then u can buy many other brands which are actually cheaper and also good in quality. And even if that product stops working you can buy two of those in the money spent for this product so basically that would last much longer than this.
643,3.0,"Pros:
+Decent sound quality
+Durable
+Easy to fit in ear
+Noise cancellation

Cons;
-Extremely poor battry life (lasts less than 2 hrs)
-Not recommended for people who love to hear original sound effects in music. (I like bass so it was okay for me)

3 star due to poor battery life. Had to recharge very frequently."
644,1.0,"NOW, I'm editing my review,
Product is good but they are worst in providing warranty service, i raised complaint for warranty and they took almost 1 month of time to get replaced my earphones. When we get in habit of use of this product then we can't live without this earphones in daily routine, and their customer service doesn't feel it, they took 1 month of time for replacement, worst ever service after sale."
645,4.0,"I got this for 900 in sale...so its a good buy at this rate.
But i ordered Boult pro bass at same rate on another site coz i wanted to compare both n then decide.
I found out that sound quality is good in both but main problem comes during the call....mic sound problem...the other person complains for for low voice.
I chose Boult one coz that was a bit better than this boat 255....sound,mic,connectivity n all!

Other features are same as mentioned...like magnetic earbuds, nice shaped neckband,tangle free cord, nice battery, etc
However, noise cancellation and bass quality is not so good...its average!"
646,1.0,"Honest owner opinion:

Sound quality - 3/5
Sound quality is better than JBL/sony wireless within this price range.

Bluetooth connectivity- 2/5
It takes long time to connect automatically. More often need to connect by clicking on device name.
Same for multiple devices. Does not auto connect to more than 1 device.

Note: within 8 months I have replaced it twice. Over the period headphone's right side has stopped working. Then the left side.

Customer care was not helpful throughout the process. Boat sent me new packed earphones in replacement. In next 3 months same thing happened again. And right side of the earphone stopped working."
647,1.0,"I googled it before purchasing this product and really found it amazing.
Today I received my order and was exciting to operate.
After listening half portion of the song I immediately removed it.
The bass quality is so high that my ears started paining and it sounds really pathetic. I didn't like the sound and not even the bass. The sound really bumps into my ear.
But still I didn't loose my hope for this product.
After this I called few people and used this product still there was some issue.
Sometimes people were not audible to me and sometimes I was not audible to them.
So guys please please don't buy this when you're looking for a nice product and if you're spending 1000 that too on wireless earphones.
So highly disappointed."
648,1.0,"Hi, I bought this on 5th Feb and it stopped working on 16 Feb 2019. I am chasing people to at least get the item replaced but not sure if they will help on this. On 16th Morning, it neither switches on nor it charges when trying to charge.
Very bad to see 2000 rs going in vain.
Mohit"
649,4.0,"Sound Quality of 255 is pretty average, falls short on lows but pretty much accepted when you get it for 999/-
Base meanwhile is a different story all together, EDM's just don't sound the same and the deep deep base just sucks you inn.
While it does falls short for crisp sound quality and treble, If you are a EDM person.. these are the best you can get for now.
P.S.: I got it for 999/- hence the acceptable remarks. Definitely not worth it for ₹3.5k get any other wired earphone instead of these if you want better bang for your buck."
650,1.0,"Actually I ordered through Amazon so,no problems with Amazon but the product is infinite times negative.I already used this product last 6 months onwards it got replaced once because left ear phone was working.Even though they replaced it again behaves like that only now both the ear phones are not working so,when I contacted boat once again they told me that I got replaced once second time wouldn't possible for me to complaint against.Overall,I will tell you to go for some branded products like Skullcandy,Seiheiser,RHA,JBL etc.,don't buy these worst products as they don't told me exact problem what happened with ear phone."

652,4.0,"One of the best earphone with good sound balance with Bass and treble. Earbuds and comfortable, it hurts initially, you need to fix it properly on the ears. I was able to take up call without any distortion. The people in the other side were able to listen without any background sound. I haven't checked the battery life. I hope it should provide at least 6 hrs.

This is my second earphone from Boat. Boat is rocking. Listening the music through OnePlus 7 !!"
653,5.0,"Its my 3rd boat product.. Havng 225 and 235....
And lovng boat.. Great products

It is really a nice product.. I bought it for 999 and its a great deal..

Pros:
Great bass
Battery backup nice.. About 6-8 hr
Connectivity ok
Multiple device can be connected

Only one problem i want to mention is for playing pubg it is not the right one.. .. There is a 1 sec delay for the sound.. Thats a problem.. But it is not a big problem we can adjzt

But overall at this price its a great deal.. Go for it"
654,3.0,"First impressions were good but after using for about 1 hour..real problems came to my knowledge...Bass is no doubt of decent quality but treble is low...i felt some point that the voice isn't clear..and i am not that fan of bass that i would compromise with the Voice quality (Treble)... Secondly the connectivity is very bad...it claims to be having a range of 10 meters but in my case lost it within 10 meters...and also the Bluetooth isn't provided with the latest 5.0..its still version 4.1..perhaps if it would have came up with the latest Bluetooth version ,the connectivity could have been better..as now all phones supports Bluetooth 5.0..i would suggest in this price range...Nu Republic JAXX 3 is a very good Earphone with great sound quality then this.."
655,3.0,"The way this product has swept the market is spectacular.

Pros: No wonder it is a thoughful asset; its built quality is decent, fits in your ears quite well, isn't uncomfortable and it is cheaper than its competitions.
It has a good bluetooth connectivity. The light weight of this earphone makes it comfortable to wear it for long hours.

Cons: The only and the biggest issue with this product is that the mouth piece is placed on the outside and because of which the listener on the other end hears almost everything but the talker. There is way too much noise because if this. It would have been better if the mic was placed in the inside. This way Boat would have been undisputably 'The Best' earphones in the market at this price!"
656,4.0,"Good product with decent battery life..... I bought it during Great Amazon sale for RS.999/- and it's worth for the money.... One of my friend bought Realme earbuds for RS. 1599/- during the same sale but when compared to Realme Earbuds, boat Rockerz 255 is way better in terms of sound output 😍. I am very much Happy with this product 😊"
657,1.0,"Sound of the headphone is superb, super punchy bass, everything was excellent but after using the product for 5 months one side of the ear is not working. Raise a complain request to Boat and on very next day one pickup executive from Delhivery came and picked up my headphone. From that day I have repeatedly trying to contact with the service centre but nobody attending my call... PURA CHINA KA MAAL HAI BHAI, ""AFTER SALE SERVICE"" KA KOI GUNJAISH HI NAHI.. I strongly won""t recommend Boat so far service is concern. Rest up to you...
PEACE"
658,1.0,"Sound quality is very bad and signal reception is very low. If I keep my phone in my trousers pocket while wearing headset, it usually doesn't work. I have to keep mobile in hand to listen to a song without frequent hiccups. The performance is worst during calls, i dont understand the problem but i receive weird disturbance while someone is speaking at other end. Its very frustrating to switch back to earpiece mode and listen again"
659,3.0,"Packing is good but I'm getting lot of noise while talking on phone
It's just 24hrs back I used to start the product but I'm not still feeling like this is new one., might be this is the first failure product from bOAT
# Not connecting phone while i kept in My pocket
# Sudden Battery discharging
# Lot of noise while on phone call
# sudden sound got disappear while playing music track
# Specially not feeling comfortable while I using at gym / Running track"
660,4.0,"Sound quality is more than commensurate with the price, esp if one likes it bass heavy.

Blutooth pairing is so painful at first that I almost returned the item to Amazon. But once my devices got paired somehow, the experience is seamless.

The isolation (noise cancellation) is better than expected. One has to be careful while using this in a public place, because it cuts you off from almost all ambient noise.

The best part of course is the lightweight yet sturdy construction, battery life (5-6 hrs), ear comfort and seamlessness. Range (7-8m) and sound quality are acceptable for the price.

At INR 1499, this is good value for money."
661,1.0,I am not very impressed. I bought a new pair because of the hype people were giving for boat products. Its very much bass focused and that's what you would like about it. My 840rs sony ex 155 does a great job than this. Its Bluetooth latency is too bad and the range is extremely poor. I own a wh 1000 xm3 but its not a comparable product. Even though i am saying compared to its lattency its too bad. And i don't know how durable it is. In my oneplus 7 pro even after turning on dolby its sound is not upto the mark. After these days of use the mic is not working. I am expecting a refund
662,4.0,"First things first, If not every one few people are curious at what price did others buy it, like am I paying too much ???? or Am I getting it at low price and book it out!!!! and stuff.
So I got this product at 1,399.00.
This is how I personally felt, so if there is anything wrong ignore it.
Now coming to pros and cons.
Pros
1 ) Base is extremely good, you don't feel like its screaming into your ear at high volume.
2) Noise cancellation is pretty good.
3) Taking calls and stuff is good.
Cons.
1) Bluetooth is a bit slow, it takes 2 sec to reflect say to pause the Song or go to next one.
2) It makes that beep sound every time hit vol +/- . Personally I hate that.
Thank you for reading."
663,4.0,"Gets 7-8 hours on full charge . It been 2 months since i bought this.
PRO's
Value for money (i bought it for 950 rupees)
Bluetooth connectivity is good.
Dedicated button for pause /play/on/off/google assistant (same button different duration of time)
another 2 buttons for volume up/down /next/ previous
Creates a vacuum in ear.
Properly fits.
CONs
Hurts ear if you wear it for long time .
Creates audio that is irritating when you put volume to mute.
Charging still done through micro usb port and not type-c.
Build Quality not for workout just wear at a desk."
664,3.0,"One of my friends was using this and ive took and seen the audio quality, felt good and ordered one, the one which i have got is good but had some problem with operating buttons so i had to return it. These guys replaced the product but the sound quality is not matching the previous one, this is about sound and

about bluetooth
for the first one i face problem when i connect and put my mobile pocket butfor replaced one im facing problem even while holding it lil closer to the headset

Overall product is good but not maintaining the same standards"
665,4.0,"Well, I am using many boat hands free accessories and I am quite satisfied with this brand name but after using this product for couple of months I am encountering a specific issue that I want highlight. It's having a very good sound quality according to it's price range but the Bluetooth coverage/range is Very poor."
666,2.0,"Positives
1.medium bass
2.good battery back up
3.stylish...can able to hear even in bed(it wont hurt ur ears when u r lying by side)

Negatives
1.very poor bluetooth connectivity.if u keep ur fone in one room and if u walk away to another room with headset,then it will get disconnected..
2.the wires are too long.so while walking it is little bit annoying by swinging.that too it touches the belly
3.when the battery gets lower,a very annoying sound keeping on repeating(its irritating..my previous headset mivi thunderbeats wont do this)
4.bad noise cancellation...it will clearly absorb all sounds at outer area.so while travelling in bike or in outdoor, opponents cant able to hear ur voice properly"
667,5.0,"Great product. Got it for a price of 999 only.
Range- As mentioned in product description
Sound- Quality is good unless you are a die hard music lover or music creator.
Might hurt your ears on extensive use.
Good for rough use.
Battery life-6hrs(verified)
I personally use it for working out, watching movies and listening to songs.
Great value for money ."
668,4.0,The build quality is quiet good. It's flexible and easy to carry. You don't have to bother about it's safety. Now comimg to the sound quality. In this price range it's very good. Base is punchy. Base lover will love it. Other sound quality parameters are also decent. you can fell that. Battery backup is really awesome. Comfortable while using for a very long time. But I deducted one star because. Sometime you can fell it's lagging. While playing pubg or asphalt. I don't know it depends upon handset or it is the problem of boat itself. But I am highly recommending it to buy.. in this price range it's really great.
669,5.0,"Using it since 5 months Super bass, sound quality, lookwise, specially charging power I charge once in a week jus fr 15-20 min
I use it while walking but can not use it in workout/exercise time as it keeps on removing
No issue with quality product😊👍"
670,3.0,After purchasing i regretted. Bcoz when i was taking calls outdoors the other party could not hear my voice properly as the mic is grabbing more outside noise than my voice. This is one heads-up to the users. If u are the person who takes calls during traffic or outdoors opposite person will literally get irritated.
671,5.0,"It is an awesome, I really like it cause the sound quality. And the most important thing is that it won't trouble your ears if you wear it for a long as I tried most of the headphones, wireless Bluetooths most of them troubles me a lot if I put them into or on my ears for a long like 1 to 2 hrs. But this one is really awesome, the bass is superb, it won't fall down from your ears while running... Amazing product. Boat rocker 255 is really rocking as the name..... If I want to rate it so definitely it will be 5/5"
672,4.0,Sound & build quality was great. Buttons are well placed and bigger for convenient operations. Bluetooth get disconnected if kept mobile in pant pocket which is irritating while jogging. Needs to resolve this problem as in 2 to 3 feet distance Bluetooth getting disconnected.
673,5.0,"Good value for the money but leaves something to be desirrd in terms of audio quality.
The wingtips get loosen over time and end up being lost .
There arnt any wingtips available for spare in the box.
This should have been a deal breaker for me if i had know this before buying"
674,4.0,"Boat rockers is a good quality earphone for this price range. Because most of the companies providing the similar earphone at double the price. I got this product at Rs 999 and l am very happy with this product. Having 4-5 hr battery backup and it charge quickly.
When I am listening music it will withstand up to 5 hrs
When I am using for audio call it will withstand nearly 3-3.5 hr
Also I can watch a complete movie with out any doubt.
And I found few disadvantages like, when you are listening music continually for hours during the journey and you keep your mobile inside your bag, then some times the music will suddenly stops and after some time it will become connected.
Also it is a very bass boosted product"
675,4.0,"Pros:
- Amazing product for a price of 999/- with 1 year warranty
- The bass is better than existing bluetooth earphones in the market
- The sound quality of it is good and accesible for daily runs
- It is splashproof so you can use it anywhere and good for gyms too

Cons:
- Bluetooth 4.2, could have been Bluetooth 5.0!
- Sound quality and noise isolation could have been better
- Takes around 1.5 hrs to charge everytime it powers out
- The fit is not as good as compared to other bluetooth earphones in
the segment but you will get used to it

But overall the performace is above average and battery backup is around 5 hrs at 85% volume and will get you through the day."
676,5.0,"Bought this from amazon prime sell @ Rs.999/- only.

Super Bass with high quality sound and awesome noise cancellation.

Near about 5 hrs battery backup after charging once.

Calling is awesome.......but one has to be in a low noisy place while calling because if the place is noisy then the other side will get those noise more than your voice.

Bluetooth range is also good without lagging.

All over it is good to use in a low cost."
677,1.0,"Quality is good but seriously not happy because of below reasons :
1)When I keep mobile in pant pocket,unable to hear or there is glitch to hear via bluetooth.
2)When are trying to see video using low speed internet,whenever video buffers and starts to play,I always hear beep sound which is very annoying.

This product is not usefull if you are hear music ,video ,audio using slow internet while on move [in car ,cab etc]"
678,1.0,"I purchased it on Friday July 26th and got it delivered on 27th .. I started using this product from Saturday.. Used it exactly for a day and it stopped working all of the sudden though battery is 40 percent left.. Tried to charge it but I could see its not charging too... While I was hearing songs, few times I could feel disturbance (Song breakdown) ... Really disappointed with this brand.. Spended 1400 for this and it's not working.. Though Amazon told me to return it and I did the same and they promised menew one, first experience is always the best and it's ruined in my case... I felt like if the replacement item also won't work, I will ask them to refund money and go for samsung level 2 spending 1000 bucks extra. . Sound quality is good but.."
679,1.0,"The earphones sound quality is ok, but when used as headphones for calling purpose, the other person keeps on complaining about the sound quality. Checked the same and found noise cancellation of the earphones is very poor.
Very disappointed with the product."
680,4.0,"After 45 days my Earphones are stopped working.. I have registered my complaint in boat website, with my invoice. After that, xpress bees agent came and take the my earphones after 15days i.e., 20th Nov'19 they sent a replacement product and now it's working fine without any issues. Thank you boat team for the replacement..."
681,3.0,"I have got this for rs.1419/- and for this range for the wireless headphone it is a good deal, sound is ok and comfortable to use, it did not fall from ear, as there is some locking type of thing, which holds the earpiece in it's place, nice product. It may feel this way because i used to airpod from apple."
682,2.0,this product is not at all a commuters product marketed as a sports earphone this earphone lags when walking and phone in pant pocket that doesnt means i hold my phone in my hand everytime amd walk or keep it near my stomach side so the connection is not interaputed i bought boat rockerzz 255 then replaced it the one was also performing the same so i came to a conclusion this is not a commuters earphone.
683,4.0,"It has been a month since I got these earphones and these are my first own Bluetooth earphones. However, I have tried many other earphones and headphones from different brands from my friends like boat, Samsung, sony, Skullcandy, jaybird, house of marley. I finally settled for this one because it's giving more than it's worth when compared to others. These are cheap in cost and rich in sound. Casual music listeners will enjoy this earphones thoroughly.
I will list some pros and cons that a casual music lover looks for...
Pros :
1)Deep boosted bass and balanced music at higher volumes...worth for money
2)Good fit, Light weight and flexible neck band with sweat and water resistant... perfect for workout
3)Around 6 hours of play time at 80% of full volume and around 1.5 hour for full charge
4) multi function buttons and different bud sizes

Cons....
1) little noise at the beginning that fades out as soon as the music starts
2) disconnection ( lag in music ) due to displacement of device for the first time only. It gets settled after the first time you move it and stays connected with out any further disruption."
684,4.0,"I recently purchased this product during the prime day sale for RS 1000. I already had Boat Rockerz 295 and purchased 255.. audio wise its too good !! And regarding noise cancellation its better than 295 along with neck pad which wasn't available in 295.

The main drawback is.... The length of the headphones are long which looks to be awkward and the wires are slimmer than 295. you need to be careful so that the wire doesn't get cut ! If in case you goin to use these headphones during driving 2 wheelers.... It's goin to hurt ur ears as the earpiece is big and will hurt when you wear helmet

I would give 4 out of 5 only because of the above drawbacks !

Boat is reliable even if they are given at less price"
685,5.0,Sound quality is very good with good bass. Its works great when comes to noice cancellation. I've tried it at 70km speed on heavy traffic area works great without any signal drops. Shows battery percentage of bluetooth. V.nice product for this price when compared to Sony products as I almost tried all sony product which doesn't support noice cancellation even after investing 6000 on bluetooth.
686,5.0,"For 999, this Boat Rocker is rock solid. Pairing it to my phone and laptop simultaneously. Google Assistant works but to ask to play music you have to unlock the phone. Will review the battery life later which seems promising for my usage. The earbud and hook also fit in my ears properly."
687,4.0,"After using about two months iam writing this review.As a hundred rupees earphone user for long time,First time i bought this boAt bluetooth earphone.Initially i had a very big hesitation to buy this earphone because of its price is about 1699.but later Waiting for a month i got this in 'lightening deal' for Rs.999 with including some cashback offers.
Pros: =>Good sound quality,a very good bass,
=>good battery backup(really it plays upto 45mins with10mins charging)
=>Fits perfectly to my ears(various sizes of extra buds added)
=>light weight
cons: No cons for sound quality,but i feel that Wires are bit lengthy(but i compromised for bass and sound quality)
Finally kudukara kaasuku worthu!!"
688,2.0,"A good product for performance but not good for that price ! Else ok for buyer,good blutooth connectivity,sound quality must say towards BASE and less TREBLE! Noise cancellation is mostly adjusted with the help it’s fitting in ears! Or may be done by active circuit then sacrificing the sound quality!
Else ok!"
689,5.0,"Very clear and crisp sound. Bass is amazing.overall a very nice quality earphone at this price range of 899,somehow the earcord are a bit longer which is a little drawbacks, but anyways we can't do anything because it's a company manufacturing style. Thanks amazon and boat."
690,3.0,"I have been using this product for exactly 40 days now, and this is what i have to say :
Good product for the money; But,

1. Takes too long to connect or disconnect to a device.

2. The Battery is its biggest con, It never really gives 6 hours of usage. And on top of that, the battery drops from 60% to 20% or less in less than 40 mins... after which it starts interrupting your music stream saying "" Battery Low"".
And the charge time is more than 2 hours, which is difficul to understand, given that it has a very small battery.

Other than that, the product is fine."
691,5.0,"Comfortable fit n good sound. My device stopped charging abt 4 months after purchase. I followed the online instructions to repair / replace the item as it was under warranty. Must say boat has a very impressive online system which is efficient n responsive. The service centre took some time but i have received my earphones back hence the 5 star rating. All electronic items can malfunction but its the after sales service that really determines the serious ones and from this it appears that boat are here for the long run. Good sound, comfortable fit, great after sales what more could one ask for."
692,4.0,Having owned multiple high end earphones I decided to buy a cheaper one for daily usage. I settled down with this after doing some research. I would say the sound quality is above average. Excellent sound stage with decent noise cancellation. When I first tired them on the voice prompt literally scared me lol. Built quality is also good but the wire length is big for me. I can connect to two devices seamlessly. I feel bass is little overpowered. Bought this for Rs.999 and it exceeds my expectation.
693,3.0,"The product really messes up the treble. Notes sounds very muffled and some high pitched beats are audible with only very little intensity. The bass is great though, you'll hear very energetic beat drops. The overall music output is still really substandard."
694,3.0,The only reason I'm giving it a 3 stars is not because I'm disappointed of the sound quality because in this price range I feel it's amazing but the quality of the ear tips is woeful. Its not even been 2 months or so that I am using it and it's already shredding to pieces. In a earphones the sound quality is the most important but you cannot ignore the quality of the ear tips because one is going to wear these for long if required. I cannot keep buying ear tips every now and then. Please improve the quality of the ear tips but great job with the sound quality.
695,5.0,"These are a decent pair of earphones at the given price. I have earlier used the Skullcandy and the JBL earphones and compared them, this is not a disappointment at all.
The sound quality, clarity and bass are quite good. The quality of voice, when using for phone calls, is pretty nice too.
The battery lasts for little more than six hours on continuous use after a single charge.
I would highly recommend these earphones."
696,1.0,"Sound quality is very good but my concern is BATTERY its getting discharge in 2 hrs.
I'm keep on replacing the product again and again but battery life is the same as mention in all the product.
4th times going to replace it but I know that product will also be same.
Hoping that product battery will be fine."
697,5.0,"After using it 10 days i am giving my review about Boat Rockers 255..
with impressive sound quality and a good battery backup almost 6-7 hours it is a very good Bluetooth headset in this price rannge..i purchased in Rs. 899 super deal..now comes to about noise cancellation so i would say while listening music you will listening nothing surrouning you but while calling if are in noise atmosphere like on road or people loudly speaking surrond you that time other side caller will not able to listen your voice properly otherside it is good product go for it.."
698,1.0,"It worked wonderfully.. But for once only.. After dat, its not getting charged, though works only when its kept connected to a charger.. N at that time connected device shows dat its 100% charged.. As soon as its disconnected from charger, its switched off.. Is this for wat we buy a Bluetooth wireless headphone.. Pathetic.. Tell me d way I can use it or if I can return it as I hav thrown away d packing"
699,2.0,"Very sad used it for only one hour daily. There is problem with the button, I can't switch them off or can change the volume. Now the battery does not last 1 hour and every day I need to charge them and can't now increase the volume. Please re think before you purchase, doesn't last long"
700,1.0,"I brought this product in Diwali offer and within 2 days it's found defect. Not connected in the phone after 7-8 times connected. even though very next day not working I checked charging code also connected on charging but not showing charging lights. Again I gave request for replacement with same product. this product supposed to replaced on 30.10.2019 but I didn't not received any replacement. I have vary bad experience with this product as well as Amazon services...
Needs to be more attention on product quality check and customer services....
This is not customer satisfaction....
Till now I didn't not get replacement
4th Nov still Amazon not taken any action after complaints logs 3 times"
701,5.0,"Soo good quality at so less price, only 'boAt' can do this. Hatts off to this company.
Clarity of sound, richness of music, perfect base, loudness, connectivity, boAt has taken care of everything, even call clarity is perfect - no echo. Great product ....."
702,4.0,"Pros:
1. Battery backup
2. noise cancellation
3. Easy connectivity
4. Best sound quality at this price

Cons:
1. if you use this continuously for more than an hour, pain starts around the ear.
2. Length of the wire is too long.

Overall recommend to buy it"
703,4.0,"6-Months review:
Pros:
1.Price- Won't get anything better for this price
2.Build Quality- Decent
3.Bluetooth-Most of the Boat bluetoot- headsets have connectivity issues but not this one
Cons:
1.Incorrectly displays battery percentage as 100% all the time and then suddenly gives a warning and dies
2.Not very comfortable!! Can't wear for more than 30 mins
3.Decent bass but poor mids and highs- not good enough

Conclusion: I would recommend you to buy ptron tango tws for 1500"
704,1.0,"The product is made of very cheap material, all the circuit and wires came off when I was taking the charger off from the device. I was shocked. The device is now a complete waste as the replacement or return period is over by few days. Also post charging the device does not give a good battery life. Other Bluetooth devices give way better battery life."
705,1.0,"This product stopped working. But when I put it on charging it is working fine, seems issue with the battery . I purchased it by seeing the review but now i regret buying it. I have sony earphones which is working perfectly even after 2.5 years. I will Never use boat again"
706,2.0,"Sound quality is very poor no bass at all. Looking good but in terms music experience which is the real purpose of headphone is like street side product which usually available near metro. Honestly I had a not good experience with Boat. So if wants you buy this product for just a show piece or decorate your neck then go ahead.

I initiated this product for Return and Refund."
707,3.0,First of all amazon should really improve their packaging the box arrived almost in smashed condition. Torn from either sides and my extra earbuds and usb cable were missing. But my rating is not based on that. It's the product. It has great bass but voice clarity and low tones are compromised. May be I am not the right buyer for this product as I don't really listen to high bass songs. Moreover it's a tad uncomfortable to my ear. But at the price range not much to complain. But my product was incomplete thanks to amazon.
708,4.0,"Hey I am using this product for last 10 days. Below is my experience.

1. Sound quality is good with nice base.
2. Comfortable in wearing and can be weared for long hours.
3. Battery life is average.
4. Worst part is bluetooth connectivity, frequent disconnection. Organization must work on this problem."
709,1.0,"Don't buy this product. Ear hooks are too loose to retain. I lost both and couldn't find new. One side stopped working within 3 months. Returned and waiting for replacement for 2 weeks. Too tough to contact customer care.

Not a good product n service is too poor."
710,5.0,"it's very very good product and no doubt about it, and its sound is pretty awesome bass sounds awesome. but you can't feel like a Samsung headphone cause it's too lower end product for sound. but still at the price point Of 1400 ok. but my original concern is that how I am gonna get service this product as I know there is no service centre near about my location so how could I change.???? can you please help me about that"
711,4.0,"Sound and bass quality is superior in price 999 as I bought during festive offers but noise cancellation is not good means not this any neckband I ever used even Samsung level u or u flex bault curve, every single neckband didn't give you noise cancellation whenever you are crowded with few people who were chattering, then the listener will also hear their voice which is more disturbing and that's why you have to put off your neckband for just to talk them for long conversation but if you are almost alone and your place is quite then this is the best neckband and if you want to buy it only for music then go for it it's amazing bass and sound quality will amaze you with it's superior quality sound."
712,4.0,Purchased 2 quantity from Amazon. Product is very good in terms of technical specs and audio playback. Quality issues with the ear buds. Both the ear buds installed is for the right ear. So it is very difficult to fix the same on the left ear. Hope this kind of issues will be taken care by BOAT's factory assembly line quality control team.
713,2.0,"This was a product suggested by many but with my comprehensive use of over two months I can say it's not a good product. The battery life on this thing is highly inconsistent even when I'm listening to music at same volume( It has happened quite a few times that I charge it to a 100 at night but it doesn't last more than an hour ). The second issue I want to point out is the Bluetooth connectivity. This device connected in a blink for a month or so, but then it used to suddenly disconnect from my device. After a month I started facing issues connecting to the device, sometimes ( even with full battery ) the device was not discoverable. As a whole I would not recommend this pair of wireless earphones."
714,3.0,"The earphones are great for casual use, I prefer some other earphones for running, training cause the wire is heavy and keeps banging onto my neck it's the worst feeling, the ear hooks are flimsy so it's not having great stability.
Sound-4/5
Quality -4/5
Comfort-3/5
For training-2.5/5"
715,4.0,The product design and usability is very good. Recieved in good condition. Noise cancellation is good enough although not working in trains. I bought it for running purpose and it doesnt quite satisfy it. The ear buds keep on falling away when you run. Tried adjusting it but still it’s the same.
716,5.0,They are my second boat earphones i owned.....sound quality is really great.....it's noise cancellation function also works well...it can be connected to two devices simultaneously...but dont why this function is needed......otherwise these are the best ones i had......as mentioned battery lasts upto 6 hrs. when fully charged......not suffering from any issues because of earphones....
717,5.0,"My review after using this product.
Honestly this Bluetooth earphones are best at this price range. Sound quality, bass quality is great. Mike is also good. Have separate volume management from android phone's volume, but make it's own volume 2,3 points low from max volume, as max volume comes with a little background noise. Bluetooth range is absolutely 10 meters. Overall great product.. I strongly recommend it.. Go for it"
718,1.0,"This is pethetic, it's doesn't offer any sort of sound fedelity, feels like you are listening from a speaker by hands, trebel is extremely bad and bass sound is muffled, it's only good for calling.

If you are looking something cheap and only for calling, ps Bluetooth connectivity is also below average, frequently disconnects while cycling."
719,2.0,"Hi all,

This headphone I have purchased to replace my 'JBL T160 in-Ear Headphones with Mic' headphone with lot of expectations from the Boat. But the sound quality of 'JBL T160 in-Ear Headphones with Mic is much better than the Boat.

But the physical quality of Boat is awesome. If u are looking for the best sound quality please dont go for it and if u are looking for the physical quality, Boat is the best under Rs.1,500/-

Headphone Quality - ****
Sound Quality - **
Base - **
Battery durability - *** (5Hrs)
Value for money - ***

Over All I can give THREE STARS for this product"
720,4.0,"Received the package on 7th May.
It's been 4 days since use.
Pros:
•Instant Connectivity (switch it on & it's connected),
•appreciable Noise-cancellation (can cut all bad vibes around you),
•all about Bass <plug into Nirvana>
•6-7 hrs assured Play Time (it's ok if you forget about charging),
•Easy to use (In-line controls on your commands), Comfortable to ears (go on for hours),
•Hardy design & Lighweight.

Cons:
•Range might be a little bit problem.(=<7ft)
•Packaging could be a lot better.
...
Anyways! It's all good at 999/- only.
(I mean right now, the price is 1,499/-)
Hope my earphone works the same in future too!"
721,2.0,"Well these aren't nearly as nice as it thought they would be using since a week, firstly they aren't even comfortable to wear and even after attaching them to the ear they get loose quite quickly and like I mentioned not comfortable another highly annoying part about this is that once you reach 20% battery you might as well assume it's zero because every 5 seconds you get a prompt, ""oops battery low"" and well the sound quality the bass and the 'noise cancelation' barely noticeable quite underwhelming sound and bass cheaper headphones have better."
722,1.0,"Product is good but very disappointed with warranty. The product started disturbing within 2 month, then after 4 month one side stopped working. I complained and they started the process of replacement and it takes like 35 days to get the replacement product. I returned the product with box and all accessories but they only gave me the product no box or accessories were there, and product color is also different which I added in this review. So overall er pathetic experience with warranty"
723,1.0,"Pros: Excellent sound quality for this price.. I would have not returned it, if it had continued to work well.

Cons : Stopped working 15 days from the date of purchase. Also, my phone had to be almost near the headphone for it to work well."
724,1.0,"Call sound is very clear, no issues. Bass is good. Very disappointed bcuz of not connecting 2 devices in same time. I RECOMMEND NOT TO BUY. Better go with Samsung Level U. If u using only one mobile means, just go with it.

UPDATE:
After 1 month of using writing this.
Please guys do not buy this scrap one. I just throwed it into dustbin.
1. Two devices not connecting in same time.
2. Very noise while in call, voice breaking, other end person hears a robot voice
3.Last two days I'm facing charging issue. I need to try 15 to 20 times

PLEASE DON'T BUY IT GUYS."
725,5.0,"The audio quality is just amazing!! Powerful bass and crystal clear audio. I haven't tested the battery's capacity though....but it took me around 1 hour to bring down the battery from 100% to about 85% at 70% of volume. So it seems the battery can easily last for 5 hours. Overall, it is an amazing earphone at this price range with excellent audio quality and noise cancellation."
726,3.0,"After using of 1 months :
1. Bass is awesome.
2. Battery is also good.
3. The design is good but the wire is bit lengthy. It feel a little out of the neck.
4. The buttons on it are horrible. Sound buttons are good but the middle can do nothing useful. It will pick up the call but u can't disconnect it from there. Also no music forwarding after two click instead it redial the last dialled no. Shitty Configuration.
5. Also after a long use , i usually get a bit of headache. Its quite often. So , i use it only when i need to other times, i had to off it."
727,5.0,Awesome product for the price paid. The battery backup is decent with up to 4 days from full charge (usage of 1 hr per day). Sound quality is too good. Only disadvantage is that the battery percentage shown on mobile is for a long time 80%. And suddenly it drops to 20%. The backup is good but the status shown is not correct.
728,4.0,"After 6 months of usage i'ld say it has min 4-5 hrs of continuous battery for 100-0%. But when it comes to noise cancellation that's tricky, i mean noise from your side is made high for other person and you'll be safe from other person's noise. Sad part is its connectivity with two devices does not work as mentioned by the company. There are even rare chances with single devices it irritates with sudden on and off connection during the call.
Overall for a normal usage its better product. i wish if there is any improvement in battery life"
729,1.0,"1 month - awesome
2 month - left earphone stopped working
3 month - right earphone stopped working
just after that.. .refer the pics uploaded.

Boat is known for it's durability. Because I have a wired boat earphone too.
But this one was a worthless, hopless and junk product.

But yes Bluetooth is still working absolutely fine (not the earphones)."
730,5.0,"Let me tell you this, I've used Bose, Beats, Sennheiser, Audio technika, JBL, Skullcandy, boAts and many tens of top and mid level brands. But I'm a fan of boAts for their Price - Satisfaction ratio and used many of their products and never was disappointed.
Bought these earphones, I liked the build as soon as I saw them, loved the thumping bass when I tested it with multiple songs, loved the audio clarity too.
And then an amazing thing happened.
I was wearing them and was riding my motorcycle a bit faster and they blew away. An SUV drove over it. I thought I lost the earphones. But when I put the buds in my ear, songs were still playing as loud, as clear as ever.
Button areas were damaged so badly but still, working perfect. I did not find any problem till now. I'm loving it.
Perfect value of money.
*I wish I could have a replacement*"
731,5.0,"I use two Bluetooth earphones ( boat and boult).
And both have good sound quality, high bass. Good competition.
But i personally recommend boult wireless earphones on the basis of convenience to use ( coz wires came from behind the neck).
At sound level both are amazing."
732,5.0,"Very well balanced. Sound is really amazing , build quality is just wow , would last for long. Bass is punchi n sound is well balanced.
Last but not the least, if u looking headset for pubg then blindly go for it, there is actually no sound delay while paying pubg I triedany Bluetooth headphone even costlier but no one manage that which boat 255 did.
Compare to latest Realme bud wireless this one is far better as I have used realme buds wireless.
Trust me, just go for it"
733,3.0,"I've ordered two products last year and listening to the quality of the headset I ordered one more. However, the second one was duplicate. While connecting, is says till boat rockers (255 was missing). By the way the cover and the headset looks like the replica of the first one which I purchased.

The sound quality and noise cancellation was perfect for the first one😊."
734,2.0,"First impression is good. Sound quality is good. But the grip to hold earphones around your neck is quite light. Sometimes it gets fly away when you are driving. Battery life is good but after using it for 9 days i felt that when the battery is 60% and suddenly it gets down to 20 so fast and recently i was at 60% and suddenly the earphones gets off. After i got replacement, the new product seems to work very nice regarding the battery life but the noise cancellation was damn bad like you can't listen to the music while driving because the noise of the wind is too loud you cant even talk.. and hence i had to return the product.."
735,5.0,"I m writing this review after 1 month of usage. Product is no doubt a value for money, quality of material is decent, battery life is around 6-8 hours. I mostly use it for office calls n response is absolutely marvelous. Earplug wires r pretty long comparative to other neck bands. Bass is good and overall a must buy in this range."
736,3.0,"Writing this after 2 months of usage.
Sound quality is good, noise cancellations is kinda ok coz whenever i talk from outside environment, the other person use to complaint about worst background noise.
The main issue is nowadays am facing is earphone disconnects from bluetooth suddenly and often while audio / video is playing. This is so irritating that suddenly if bluetooth disconnect mobile speaker enables which disturb others."
737,4.0,It's a very good product.... Just don't wear it in rain because the earphones miggt be water or sweat resistant but battery and chipset is not that much....besides that its a great earphone..you can recive calls handlessly and play pubg without wires comming outta your phone...plus in the gym you can keep you phone aside during workouts and enjoy music ....and you can change songs...volume ... Redial ...pause/play using the buttons given...overall a handsfree experience with superb sound quality and the eargrippers do their jobs as well...
738,3.0,It's a good product for the price but if you are expecting to amazing sound quality then it's not for you it's a decent package but mid and lows are lacking bass is power full sound is clear backup is good and that's it! I personally am fan of Sennheiser but this is way more cheaper then that so decide for yourself and yeah it's better that jbl in this price range...
739,1.0,"Disappointed with the Experience. The selling point for me was the battery life and the sound system which was expected to be good. But it’s really disappointing. I tried to give these away to another guy for free who returned it to me for free

And I can’t even return this product! I can only get replacement! The vendor is really really looking to off-load these products. PEOPLE! PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS"
740,5.0,Great earphones.. i got it during diwali sale for 1k... And I'm using it since then.. sound and bass is great.. battery life is good too. Play back time is nearly 7hours and charges quite fast too.. looks smart... U can go for it if you want a Bluetooth headphone..
741,4.0,"Hello everyone, this bluetooth earphone is really awesome at this price range. Best thing is that this is flexible so if you sleep using it this with not damaged as Samsung Level.
Bass is really awesome. Noise cancellation is okay and bluetooth connectivity is good.
After using some day I found that battery is works for more that 6 hours. If you work in office and only using for attend call, battery will work for about 12 hours. And almost in every phone if you used it for about 6 hour this may show full or 80% battery but it comes down immediately, this if not a battery, this is a software problem that not show battery falling slowly. This is really nice."
742,1.0,"First of all..i am really disappointed with boat's customer care service..i purchased them on 17th november and on..25th of december the charging port was not working at all...i registered a complaint on the very same day..the product was replaced with an already damaged product...the voice quality was not good while calling...additional voices were heard on call on the other side...
What kind of customer care service is this??
It was such a waste of money..
Will never ever purchase any boat product again in futurenor will recommend anyone to purchase it..
I have registered a complaint again...eagerly looking forward to boat'service...thankyou..!!"
743,3.0,"Bass and treble are unbalanced, there is much bass compared to treble. Product is good for extra bassheads. Battery backup is good. Build quality is great.
Comparing it with ant audio wave sports 540, ant audio clearly wins, i would suggest u to buy ant audio in the same price segment (If u like balanced music bass=treble) ant audio is a perfect choice.
+Points of boat
Better grip in ear, hooks don't hurt
Turns off automatically when not connected.
Flat wires
+ Points of ant audio
Bluetooth 5.0
Bass and treble are perfectly balanced
Battery backup is better than boat (around 1.5 hours extra)
Calling quality is great"
744,5.0,"I am using it for quite a time now & i have to say it's the best one in this price segment. Sound Quality is outstanding with High Bass, it doesn't get wet even when i sweat a lot by running while wearing it. The noise cancellation could have been a little bit better, when on call the other person keeps telling me that background noises keeps on coming. Battery backup is awesome also, it remained on 100% even after playing videos & songs constantly for 3hrs. To sum it up, i have to say it is the best Bluetooth headset under 1500. You should really go for it."
745,5.0,Boat products always come onto the expectations! Boat rockerz 255 pass my expectations!...The product finish is very good and the look is of premium earphones...the sound quality is good if u are a bass lover!....also the noise cancellation is pretty good if we compare with other earphones....The fit of these earphones is very good and comfortable and do not hurt your ears even after prolonged use. I have also been out in light rains wearing these and i am quite impressed with its moisture wicking!....also the earphones are very light weight and don't even feel on your neck which is a must condition for Bluetooth earphones!....overall it is the best buy for 999/-.
746,5.0,product is good as music lovers but for calling purpose not that much good. connectivity rang is not good.company saying battery backup is 6h but not more then 4h
747,4.0,"Good Sound (not excellent though)
great comfort
but one run in the rain, and the LED indicator dimmed. it took a lot of time to recharge (not sure of future)

Battery life is V.average (may be 2 hours maxxx).
Cant run a Marathon for sure..."
748,5.0,"Excellent sound
excellent noise cancellation
and excellent bass
I would love to buy again for my sister fantastic deal at 999
😢the only thing I I want that boat Rockers is missing that if headphone is connected then it doesn't vibrate for call just giving a reminder incoming call but overall very much value-for-money very much comfort to wear excellent battery backup"
749,5.0,"The boAt Rockerz 255, while being lightweight in design pumps out the favourite tunes with powerful HD sound and deep boosted bass.
It can differentiate music from noise.
An exceptional sound experience with articulate audio reproduction with a blend of pitch perfect frequency response.
According to me everything is awesome except one thing :-
The cover of the charging port.
By any means if it tear aparts then I think it's very tough to fix it up again in the same place. Maybe fevikwik can fix it but do not try this.
Hope that moment will never come because it depends on how you use it. Overall product quality is just mesmerizing."
750,4.0,One thing about boat products are it's low price. I got this for 999 rs. The noise cancellation is not too notch. At times there a Bluetooth connectivity issue. One can use it for jogging and all. It's splash proof. Overall value for money . A must buy if you are in budget
751,5.0,"Valo head phone kharap na akta good quality product .bt amr j ta experience,,,, ai headphone a majhe majhe amr theke onno loker ba garir horn ba music sound besi sunte Pai jar stathe Ami kotha boli...

752,5.0,"Got a great deal on prime day.. bought this wonderful product
It's simply perfect, sound quality is too good, connects to the phone very easily
Charging lasts throughout the day, with good amount of calls & music too
I would recommend a buy"
753,4.0,Only to sae battery little bit weak and the finiahing of rubber material is very goid also i using in rain season not at all problme also sweat happens no effect or damage occur to headphones very nice auperb headphone.rest sound of bass and treble sound is awesome i buy from amazon.in thanks amazon . From.chepas headphones better buy this one I recommend to all..
754,3.0,The charging percentage is not showing clearly. Always it shows 80 % and suddenly drops to battery low. Microphone is very far away from the mouth and is in opposite direction. So that the surrounding noise is clearly heard than our voice to the other end person. Long time using tends to bring you ear pain as it is not ergonomically designed it gives us pain because of the ear buds. The wire width is larger than it appears on the photo and is not comfortable while run or working out. And the main disadvantage is it completely didn't allow outside noise while using hence it is not recommended during driving
755,1.0,"Waste of money, people who all reviewed it as great seems they rated it for no good reason

1. Sound quality is extremely poor and it feels like a local headphone which is sold in the market. NOT upto the mark.
2. Battery drains in no time, charging hours compared to listening hours will be less."
756,1.0,Got this product from amazon but replacing it with 24hrs as bluetooth stop working..I had to keep my phone about half hand distance for Bluetooth to connect.. Sound quality and look n feel is awesome..hoping to get a replacement with a defect free product. Got a replaced one and returing that eithin 10 days as bluetooth stoped working
757,5.0,"Recommended by my friend avinash as he is using from past 3 months. Now using it from last 2 month happy , satisfied , saving time. By doing simultaneous work by hand as well as by phone"
758,1.0,"Worst product & waste of money, unlucky that I checked the product after completion of return date and now have to bare the loss of Rs.1700/-, as can hear the sound from one side head set only, did not expected this from AMAZON.
Won't recommend anyone for this product and AMAZON.
Extremely worst as I bought it to gift my spouce on account of our 1st Anniversary.
Worst product and the dealer."
759,4.0,"I used it for the past 10 days.
It is really good for watching movies and for phone calls. I love it for that.!
It's really bad for music. Not only this all other Bluetooth earphones in this range
I tried leaf sport 2, leaf collar 2(sounds similar to this one).
jbl 110bt (hate it can't tolerate its sound quality for 10 sec).
Now i am buying a wired for my music love and gaming lag in bt earphones.

If movies and phone calls are ur priority go for it best in this range alternate would be leaf collar 2

If music is ur love then try staying with wired ones though it seems old fashion.

Honestly guys even 500 rupees wired earphones are better then bt 2k headphones. Even mi basic sounds better while listening music 🎶."
760,5.0,"Although I am Senhiser User But Got this recommendation from my friend Get this for 999 and What a master pice it iss Although Base Isss Quite High but love everything about this earphone Wires are nice magnet work perfectly And Battery is also Kind Of nice but not excellent But love at this price Point .
Cant get better that that In wireless"
761,2.0,"The earbuds are not at all good , in quality as well as it will not fit in your ear properly.
Battery life is good and sound quality is below average.

There are better options available in the market in terms of technology and value for money.
I bought it just because Indian company making a product and and the in the add display it was appearing quality product.

I bought this product @1999 INR , and after week i saw someone is selling it @1499 INR .
But I'm not a kind of buyer to return the product just for money difference."
762,3.0,First thing i bought this 899 in great indian festivals yup damn offer after got my product same excitement with opening box when connect to my phone it show 100% battery i thought it was used product so i have used for few day my friend having same earphone he have more bass when compare to mine then just now i face issue that it automatically open google assistant in for while today i faceing this issue i have placed replacement hope i ll edit after my product get replaced but overall it good sound and it doesnt not fit perfectly then cable lenght is large i ll update in a week see u soon i ll give 3 start once my earphone get replaced i ll give 5 star
763,1.0,After reading many positive reviews i bought it. Within 2 Months of use i started getting connectivity issues when song is playing suddenly it will get disconnect. I Checked with other phones and Laptop found out headset is the problem claimed warranty. They will provide you a phone number but it wnt work everything is in email though it took 15 days to get my replaced product which i got now i was happy that i got replaced but it didnt last for 10 min too i felt too bad when my replaced product stopped working in 2nd song itself worst worst worst product. Who will give faulty product for replacement better go for some other option waste of money ......
764,4.0,"Well i used boat products before they are good as they were before.
pros - base is good , water resistant ( here doscription says IPx4 but my earphone box says IPx5, and that is even better , you should update your product description. ) , Magnet lock , design .

Con - cable is a bit long. As it has control box both side and a little hard cable at back, the remaining cable shouldn't be this long.

Above all its a good product. Recommend to all the people who wants to buy a cheap but best wireless earphone.
5 people found this helpful"
765,1.0,"First of all I during call , sound quality is not good and also there is echo and disturbance sound.
Secondly for music lover it is not good , I would recommend to go for other earphone
Lastly during travel signal is getting break.
So go for some good quality earphone with some extra money that would be really pleasing for you"
766,2.0,"There will be continuous humming voice in background which will be irritating while pausing/playing sound.
Not suitable for calling.mic is not that good quality.
one more demerit is that rubber strap on earphone. that is just sticked with glue which gets off in 3 days only.
Though purchased for only rs.955/- even returned for bad quality"
767,4.0,I am using these headphones last 3-4 months. It's Nice and Good Headphones. Sound quality is really nice. Build quality is also good. Bluetooth Connectivity is superb. You can use two device at a time. Some mobile devices you can listen music between the calls That's great thing. But when i talk with others on phone calls that time background noise of other callers you can here compared to the person voice you can't hear properly that time. But its happen when you are in rush or crowded area. The noise cancellation can improved by bolt Rocker so it is really superb budget Bluetooth headphone in india.
768,1.0,"I bought the product as the reviews were good. I even liked it as it is a descent one. It was the price point I thought was little higher Rs 1699 but then I thought that it being a Branded product hence the price could be high.
What I am regretting right now is that I bought it at 1699 and within 2 weeks the price has dropped to 999.
I feel like betrayed."
769,2.0,"not that great sounding earphone i will recommend that others should invest little bit more and buy the mivi earphones that is obiously better sounding than these pair of earphone ... and there is lot of problem regarding connectivity also when the earphone battery percentage becomes 80% then there is crack in the sound.
and if you expect good vocals then this is a trash only there is bass which also becomes muffled after the battery drops to 80%.. for me this product is absolutely no. But one good thing that i found is that it has a good battery life."
770,3.0,Build quality is not impressive. Noise cancellation is good. Light weight and easy to use. Call quality is good. Bluetooth connectivity is ok. Battery backup is good enough. But clarity of sound for which you buy is not impressive. Only bass effects you can feel but not up to the mark of prominency.
771,4.0,"Everything is is perfect but if you are buying this earphones for playing games ""pubg"" dont buy these earphones because there is a delay of sound for about one second and that really effects our game play but for calls and videos or songs these earphones are perfect at the price i got it for 899 Inr
Review after 6 months
leftside of the earphone stopped working but after i visited the service center i got a replacement within 10 minutes no extra question were asked"
772,2.0,"Headphones have servere connectivity issues I use the Redmi note 4, the rockerz start having disturbance and voice starts breaking as soon as I keep my phone inside the pocket. Returned the product once 2nd one also had the same issue.

Way of keeping them on the neck with magnet is great.
The noise cancellation is pretty good but at the same time is dangerous, it blocks out traffic noise totally.

Audio is average, artificial bass dominates everything. Audio quality lacks basic details.

Call quality was decent till the time there was no Bluetooth connection issues.

Switched to tagg inferno, audio quality is much much better, connectivity problems are close to absent."
773,4.0,"I read most of the review's before buying this earphones and i ended up buying this amazing boat rockerzz, the sound clearity is okayish but oh man, the bass, it's amazing and the connectivity is brilliant, i walk from one room to another without taking my phone and it works flawlessly Without any glitch.
The problem in most of the bluetooth earphone is you have to press and hold the power button for almost 3 second to turn it on and the same for turning it off or shuffling between songs which is annoying.
Wire postioning is good but it can be better.
The battery almost lasts for about 3 days if you use it fot 2 to 3 hours a day and the ear hooks are excellent for outdoor activities with this earphone.

After all with my personal experience i can tell everyone that you can but this phone bluetooth earphone if you want good sound clearity, amazing bass, a decent battery life, and comfortable to use."
774,5.0,"Review after 15 days of usage - The Bluetooth connectivity is awesome. Never faced any pairing issues and range is approximately 5 to 8m (from one bedroom to next) after that disconnected.

Sound quality is good, bass is OK.. Not that much in comparison with boat extra bass wired headphones.
Using it during travelling in trains buses.. Nl issues"
775,4.0,"I have used Boult earlier and now this one.

Sound quality is definitely better, however the battery life is on lower side.. continuous use of 4-5 hours will drain it, volume levels are lower too.

Good for listening music and watching videos, performance is not upto mark for voice/video calls .. lacks the clarity.

Nevertheless; for the price, it is its a good buy depending upon your usage patttern."
776,5.0,"Good product in such a great price. I have bought it for 899₹. I have been using this product from 1 month.
1. The sound quality is good with bass.
2. Battery live is good almost 8 hours of continuous use.
3. Very flexible and no worries during the time of traveling even you go on sleep on your neck it doesn't give any feelings.
4. I travel through train every week. When i plug this earplugs not a bit sound enters from outside.
5. Even having a call is no more problem. You can recieve and deliver your message without any problem."
777,4.0,"Best deal if you are getting it under 1500. They are easy to use and sound quality is exceptionally good, which is least expected at this price. The built is such that they don't easily fit in any carry case especially not in the one which is mentioned in bought together catagory. The battery time is great but the info regarding the percentage battery left can be deceptive as displayed. One moment it displayes 60 % and next moment it's exhausted. But the backup is great . Can be listned for more than 4 hours when connected"
778,1.0,"Overall one of the worst product I have come across... This is the replacement product because 1st one was not working properly( voice level in 2nd side was too low). I was hoping that replacement product will be a good one but what?? I called my brother and can not listen to him, he is also not getting my voice. Tried so many calls but result was same.. Extremely disappointed with Amazon service and boAt product first time.. Going to post review on social media(Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc) and on some websites as well.. A very very disappointing product. Will try to not buy anything from Amazon after this incident.
Goodbye Amazon.in"
779,5.0,"Fits perfectly.i am using it for more than an hour and is still very comfortable.red colour looks nice.Music sound is pretty good.bass little high.when you play a song you can't hear a thing from your surroundings,though I've not tried it in crowded place.call quality is good.bluetooth range is not upto the mark.priced around 900 during GIS makes it more worthy.Overall i am happy with my purchase."
780,5.0,"I've tried 3 different earphones of the same model and in each one I observed that the audio skips even when the phone it's connected to, is right in my back pocket.

While listening to music, the audio quality is decent and battery life is about 5-6 hours depending on the volume levels. On calls, the audio is also decent and others were able to hear me clearly.

Overall, it's a decent pair of in-ear earphones within 1500 bucks as compared with JBL."
781,3.0,"Used it for 4 months, sound quality is good, extra bass effect is also good. Decent sound on calls, movie clearance is really good. charging time is 2hr and play time is 7-8hrs continue, on call time 5hrs, stand by time is more than 24hrs.
Connectivity is fast n easy, BT range is good when compare with other brands,
Durability - Can't say about it as for mine, left sided stopped working, cannot clam the warranty as the amazon bill is faded completely no soft copy available."
782,4.0,"1 week and no issue still eligible for replacement. Nice product when I've bought this it came with battery 100% charged. Easily give you upto 5.5 hrs of playback. Bluetooth range is not that good I mean if you always need to go away from your device from where you are playing this earphones then you will find that, range is not that good but if you aren't go away from device like you use it while using laptop or you use it with mobile phone and while listening you keep your phone in pocket or in simple words if you are not going away from it then it is best for you but for people who needs more range then this is not for you. Talking about sound quality nice little bit bass boosted but you will love it. Noise cancellation works fine."
783,3.0,"Product is ok ok. Sound is ok.
Quality of wire is questionable !
As i red circle weakest part of the product. Donot know how long it will be durable ?
Possible wire cut or damage in long run since it is always get repetitive bend while placing on neck and removing. However i will try to treat this part very carefully.
But this area could be robust."
784,4.0,"I got a defective unit....... Its not turning one than i tried to connect it to charger and its start working but after removing charger it turned off again.....no sing of any light or anythin......there might a battery issue.....just book a replacement order, than try its sound quality

Edit-i got replacement....new unit is good but some times i feel disturbance when enjoying music"
785,2.0,"Good Product... But very disappointed with quality because just in 15 days one side of it stopped working... & I have tried to complaint but their complaint handling way is too bad... I've returned it 10 days back but I didn't receive any replacement yet.
So I am so disappointed..."
786,1.0,"Actually I thought this product is good..that's why I purchased this last week... From starting day only fully I'm disappointed bcz package and delivery is good.. but product quality is not good... It's automatically disconnected while I'm talking in call.. soo much disturbance sounds, and charging capacity also very low. Really it's a rack product bcz this exactly opposite to what they given What they given in features ..

This earphone helpfull for only lessening videos and audios. For that also charging capacity is very low..

Please help me how can I replace it..."
787,3.0,Sound quality is good. Speaker is very poor. Voice is not audible. Other surrounding sound is much higher to the person on call. The person on the other end of a call stuggles to hear the voice. It's only good for listening to music not for taking calls.
788,4.0,"In the matter of Sound Quality, it falls behind Boat 225, however as this is bluetooth model, can be sort of fine. There is no lag at all, and thats very good, tried while playing PUBG, PrimeVideo, Netflix, Youtube. Noise Cancellation is really good, notifications for calls, turn on and turn off. Over all I rate 3.5/5.0"
789,5.0,I have used this product for a week. First review of this product I must say is good battery life and awesome sound quality. I have used this headphone for making average phone calls and listen music for an hr or 2 per day and battery lasts fir 2 days. Also watch 2 movies continuously by single charge. It also connects with my smart TV.
790,3.0,One side stopped working after 6 months of use. Got replacement which had the same problem.I will say don't go for cheap products buy another good headphone. Though lows are quite good.Sound quality is good.Not sturdy product.All of the boat product I've used and I've seen people using in headphone range always gives some problems.
791,4.0,"So after using it for more then 20 days I am writing this review ,first of all this gadget is cool in looking and working also ,
but it will not work as per the specified effective range to operate, i have paired it with asus zenfone laser 3 and few other devices ,facing the same problem.
Talking about the battery backup ,it is awesome ,charging time is very fast and long lasting .
The best part of this is that ,it is very comfortable to wear without any hassle or if you are a music lover that prefer to hear music most of the time than you can go with it, but you can check other option as well in the same price range ."
792,5.0,"I purchased this headset for 1500 and after using for 2 days,this is what I felt
Pros:
1. Terrific Noise cancellation
2. Sweat proof(Justified it's IP rating)
3. Awesome Battery life( More than 7 hrs for me
as I was using medium volume just for a 1.5
hr charge)
4. Premium sound quality while listening to
music

Cons:
1. Bluetooth Range, (although they mentioned
it to be 10 m), was very less, around 7 m.
2. Conical buds ( removable)
3. Voice call quality was not as expected"
793,1.0,"After 6 month it is not working. After visiting boat style website and register complain, I received ticket no and pick up number but when trying to track using the link provided no details found. After 1 month I got a person mob no through sms from boat like call him and guide him about your address and handover the item but calling 100 times he didn't received my call at all. No response from boat customer also. Now its been 3 month before complain register, I am writing bad experience which I had with them and swear that no purchase in future from boat. Also informed every freind not to waste money if service is not good."
794,3.0,"It's fine for this price range, ear is paining during long usage. Some connectivity issues are there while it's already connected to some other device. Buttons are ok. Battery Percentage which is getting displayed in the Bluetooth icon of phone is not correct. While it's in 60% itself it's getting switched off. Battery backup not that great.
No premium feel, if u r looking for that then it's not for u...
Sound quality is pretty decent"
795,5.0,"Wonderful quality, connects seamlessly. Superb bass and audio quality, only thing bothering is a slight hissing background noise during movie playback when connected to TV. Otherwise, this is a wonderful product, slightly overpriced I feel though..."
796,5.0,"It's an excellent purchase offering full VFM. The cheaper headphones i used previously used to give me headache after a couple of hours, so was reluctant to try these at first. But have been using Boat Rockerz for a couple of months now and they are really good.
The only problem i faced is the battery % it shows on the cellphone. Like when i start the bluetooth device it would say that it has 80% battery remaining (which couldn't have been the case as the headphones were charged over a week ago and were used for at least 5-6 hours) ... and then after 20 mins the battery is zero."
797,5.0,"So I have been using them since 3 months.
Nice built and cancels noise upto good extreme.
Bass is fantastic.
As per some reviews they said that phone calls were not clear enough but I don't have any issue regarding that.
It's pretty much clear and audible.
3 months down the lane and they're good to go."
798,2.0,"I had purchased the product few months back.......and one of the earplug has stopped working....Even buying such a branded product at a expensive rate ,quality is not good.
My suggestion for you would be kindly work on the product quality..... because the product which I have received has not yet completed 6 months also and it has stopped working.

Till yesterday only 1 pair was not working, and now both the earplugs are not working.......it was such a pathetic experience......and I would never suggest anyone to buy this earphones"
799,1.0,"This is a stupid product, I feel they have cheated by sending fake copy product, it worked only for 2 weeks, and now the sound is unclear and very low, I'm unable replace now, service centre is in Mumbai, how can I go from chennai to Mumbai?? Instead buy some good brand like Samsung level u, amazon pls tell how to use the warranty and repair or replace it"
800,5.0,"Awesome product. Works fantastic. Thanks for giving the freebie. Worth the penny.

Pros:
Good battery life
Sounds qlty is awesome.
Easy to pair and disconnect.

Cons:
Nothing so far.

Would recommend to buy this product as its best in this price range."
801,5.0,"I purchased this item 2 months back, and it cost me around 250 rupee after cashback. And in this range this is the best wireless earphone.
Battery - around 7 8 hours.
Connectivity - You can connect 2 device at a time (phone and laptop).
bluetooth range- Range is very good I used in 3 bhk flat and its good after moving in other rooms.
Noise Cancellation - tested using the bike and other side there in no noise of the traffic and all.
Quality - Sound and build quality is very good.

Overall very good earphone. Good to go with it in this price range."
802,4.0,I bought the product and use 1 years then I written review. Sound quality is good something problem in flex cable you can try to hurt if you broke the flex cable. When you're using please scary use it is my requirement and the product is so good you can use for your sport.
803,2.0,"Everything thing is the best ..
Sound quality ,bass, micro phone etc etc ..

But the main problem is that after using 6/7 months left side of bud stopped working and the exact same thing happened with my sisters earphones , thats why I have decided to write review ..

When we pay 1500 we expect at least we can use the same for a year and the problem is warranty they provide is only for only 6 months ..

So take decision accordingly 🤣

Otherwise these were one of the best earphones I have ..

Something I still use my old earphones and the right bud is giving his 100%🤣🤣"
804,1.0,"Purchased boAt Rockerz 255 Sports ear phones on 29th March2019. Stopped working in 3 days. Had to replace it.

Now it's been 3 months and it stopped working completely.

Very bad product. What's the use, when u pay so much and cannot use it even for a year."
805,1.0,"I have been using this product since 3 months. Initially it was working fine but now the bluetooth connection breaks automatically with the phone. Tried switching off and on several times, it's not working fine. Not recommended. Even I dont know where to complain since I dont find a service centre. Would request amazon to provide me assistance with boat rockers service centre"
806,4.0,"One of best BT Earphones at this price range, noise cancellation is really awesome. BT connectivity is good some time when mobile is on pocket lite disconnections for Milli seconds...other than this product is good at this price range, audio sync with video is perfect.....!!! Boat is best at this"
807,1.0,"Bluetooth connectivity is not as expected.
Brought for 990rs and now it's for 2k that's way too much. People are not fool, if they have 2k budget then they'll go for jbl wireless earphone for 2000 rs instead.
I believe review should be with respect to current price only which is 2k..."
808,5.0,"Amazing Product. I never thought I could trust electronics products online but here I am standing corrected. These headsets are really durable, comfortable and exactly what I needed. They fix up good in your ears and thus can be used while running or workout. The battery capacity is unbelievably great."
809,4.0,"After 8 months , one of the earphone stopped working I contacted the manufacturer Boat to repair or replace the the item as it got defect within warranty period . They arranged pickup from courier xpressbees , and and now for the last one month I'm waiting for the item , there is no clue where that has gone ."
810,1.0,"I am using the product for more than one month. Bluetooth connectivity is pretty good, no issue. Battery is fine. Sound quality is just average, nothing special. But the noise cancellation is terrible. You can barely hear properly when you are on a busy road, and the person on the other end would be experiencing the worst voice ever. It picks up and enhances all other external sounds much more than yours.
So guys, please don't go for this product, unless you have enough to waste. You would want to throw it away after a few days, otherwise people would stop talking to you.
I would rate it negative if I could."
811,2.0,"Zero noise cancellation...other end person can hear background people/noise louder than you and really disturbing to whom you’re speaking with avoid using for calling. Sound quality is not that good, it’s ok ok. Bluetooth connectivity and battery life is good."
812,3.0,"The bass is amazing. It's good for listening to music. Fit may vary, I have issues with left ear fit. The mic does not cancel background noise, it's a nightmare for person on other side of the call. The battery life is short."
813,3.0,It was working fine till last week but suddenly right-side earpiece stopped working after 9 months of normal use. As it was in warranty I have returned it to the Boat service center and waiting for replacement or repair. I will update my review after the repair or replacement.
814,1.0,"I WAS ALREADY USING boat rockerz 255 before buying this item, but its not of that quality, it doesn't say boat rockerz 255 after pairing, sound is to loud like an ordinary earphone, no voice cancellation feature in place, moreover what is hands free mic I did not receive it, I was looking for surround sound as described in your 'MORE DETAILS' it's disappointing to say the list"
815,3.0,"I was not at all satisfied with the boats premium product.
1-it was to heavy always feels on running
2- poor battery life with poor indications
3-after 20% life auto disconnect and does not get connect again
4- while running or jogging it's connection get lost
5-To much sound disturbance.
6- no use sound cancellation feature.
7- Audio quality is ok
8-Call quality is also ok but not clear get broke in between.
Overall only one good thing is sound rest is over priced"
816,3.0,Really not worth the expectations they showcase. Battery runs out quicker than what I'd expect it to stay. Sound quality is not worth its competitors at its range. Calls via bluetooth has a bit of a lag and noise. But overall it is usable if u plan not to use it more than half an hour a day.
817,3.0,"Writing this review after using 2 weeks.
Overall it's an average product, not too good not too bad.
Battery backup was also not satisfactory but not too bad at the same time. I have only one issue with the battery indication. It was showing 100% then 80% and then directly down to 20% and off. There's no in between. Boat should take a look for this problem.
Sound quality, noise cancelation were above average, Satisfied for this criteria. Bluetooth connectivity is good can be more better.
Overall this is a good product."
818,4.0,"The sound quality is awsm considering the price range.
Bass is superb.
Battery backup is awsm.
Call quality is up to the mark.
Bt only thing i dont like in this earphone is sound delay in pubg.(if it is possible so plz fix it in next model)
Ovell all its value for money only for music lovers
Plz don't buy it for pubg or gaming."
819,2.0,I have been using Boat wired earphones and bluetooth speakers but boat rockerz doesn't even sound like Boat. A genuine suggestion to those who buying boat rockerz over Mi sports wireless earphones Please don't go with the looks of this product. Sound quality is pathetic it sounds more like some local product. Looks and build quality is fine does the job but but fails to deliver crisp and groovy sound which you would expect from a earphone at this price range. Replaced twice not satisfied. I doubt if this seller is selling genuine product.
820,4.0,"Good to have this,
Cons:
1.ear bud sometimes irritating
2.supporting ear rubber is only 1 piece and can be ditatched easily
3.battery backup is not good..when it will shouts last 80 percent battery remains means we only left 20 mins or so...
4 .magnet is not that strong as it should be"
821,1.0,"Got this free with Huawei Y9 2019, claimimg that they are 3000 INR earphones. The sound quality is worst with Huawei Y9, Zenfone 3, MI devices. Not even worth 3000 INR but works good with lenovo devices."
822,3.0,"this should have come with a disclaimer-you will never look like Jaqueline Fernandez that you find in the manual coming along with this product. What I meant is not the cosmetic beauty of hers. The wire has to be twisted before you plug into the ear or it sticks out giving you an embarassing look in the public. This I learnt after several months into buying the product. Jaqueline was lucky enough to have somebody help her with the twisting part. On other accounts,

Sound Clarity - 4/5
Noise cancellation - 2/5
Gym compatibility(sweat, chaos) - 5/5"
823,5.0,"Packaging was good (thanks to Amazon), sound quality is good. But the amazing part is it's bass which is (to be honest) beyond expectation. I have also taken feedback from my friends while being on call about it's audio quality and noice cancellation, and it's all good, you won't receive any complaint with that. Battery backup will not disappoint you either, it can last upto 2-3 days with a fair usage of 4-5 hours a day. if you are looking for a value for money deal this is the best option to go with."
824,1.0,"I bought this earphones in Sep 2019, it was working decent and started failing recently. I called the service center in Chennai, Cell tech, pathetic service and response was even worse, its like they dont even want to answer you. Would I buy or suggest anyone to buy this, never in my life, not just this, will never buy any product from Boat brand."
825,1.0,The length of the wire is too long and it's quite inconvenient while it's not plugged into the ears! And there is no return.yiu have to live with what you have got.thwre is only replacement with the same model of same brand allowed.thats unfortunate.Iam totally disappointed.how can I predict the feel of the wire length before ordering and tried testing it once?!
826,4.0,"Received this today and it sounds good but some thing is not good for me that are :
1. Bluetooth range is not more than 7m
2. Wire when we wear looks awkward
3. Sound is not that great but but bad
4. In my phone it always shows it be fully charged
These are the things but I'll keep this product just because some times i don't feel comfortable using normal earphone and for that times i needed a Bluetooth earphones
Also for wire I've done a modification by just using wire tie which i felt useful for me
Attached a picture of the same"
827,1.0,Very bad product. Seems I received a poor quality one. The earphones one of the bud broke. No sound coming from it now. Even before breaking the sound quality bwas poor. Seema I wasted my money on these. I wish to get a replacement or refund.
828,5.0,"This product is worth of money and the quality and the material of this product . This is made by the best sound quality company which is boAt they have extra Bass with extra quality it is good for doing yoga and while jogging , in sports the distance between your any device with this is very good and it needs a little bit charge in a week in a week , it gives 1 year warranty by the boAt and a very good quality and Amazon is providing us very fast in delivery so thank you"
829,3.0,"I really did expected something good from this earphones. The sound quality is neutral, Bluetooth range is not so good(maybe 6 meters at home, 9 meters outdoors) and latency is observable(when you notice that is(^o^), battery life is decent as it is new (will write once it's a few months old) and please don't fall for the 2 device connecting at same time. It's so poorly engineered that if u connect to 2 device after 5 mins of work (:-P) it flickers and sometimes disconnects. The build looks promising but the ear hook is specifically made for people with long ears ( it hurts my ears during prolonged use)."
830,2.0,"If you are looking for a product which would be reliable to you for the long term then this is not a product for you.
It has a year warranty
After 9 months of usage, one earbud stopped working. I raised the complaint to their customer service. I received a replaced product after a month. Then again using for 15 days it does not get switched on and not able to pair to any of my devices.
So if spending 1000 bucks and thinking to use if for a year or more.
This product will more in the service center than with you."
831,4.0,"Good product at this price, i got it in sale in 999. Sound quality is good, connectivity is also good, but you will start loosing connectivity when you keep your cellphone in back pocket. It has good bass, vocals can be better. Overall satisfied with the pelroduct."
832,4.0,It was a good buy. But Bluetooth connectivity has an issue. At times i lose connectivity when my phone is in lower pocket. Sound quality is good but not at par with Wired earphones in same price range. Noise cancellation is fairly ok. But wind noise isnt cancelled.
833,4.0,"these earphones are very good for the sound they produce .connectivity has no issues ,comfortable for long periods of time , sound quality is very good and low frequency bass sounds are good (not super heavy bass) ,good for watching videos and movies , gaming has little lag in sound (due to wireless connection),battery life is fairly good (around 4-5 hrs of non stop usage at full charge at medium volumes) ... sound quality does not deteriorate at full volumes ..... built quality is good , does not feel cheap and flexible neck band ...good deal for =<rs.1500"
834,3.0,"I bought this product in Jan 2019, and now in May 2019 one of its earpieces has stopped working. The earphones performed well while they were working. The sound quality was good, and connection with the phone remained solid throughout. Full chsrgey took around 2-3 hours and it lasted for 6-7 hours on an average.
The mic is a little weak, I had to often repeat what I said as the voice wasn't clear sometimes on the other end.
I used them extensively for jogs and gym and they performed admirably, never getting out of the ear midway and the coiled around the neck pretty comfortably.
Just expected them to last more than just 4 months."
835,1.0,"I bought this on 24/04/2019..
Ones side of it stopped working since 28th June... I requested for replacement..
They picked up my product on 4th July..
Till now (06/08/2019) I didnt get repalced product...
They have customer care no. vch they never lift.. In 100 attempts they answered my call only once... and asked about ticket no. I provided my complaint token no....Then they siad due to technical problem status is not showing...then they cut my call without any further information... I lost Rs. 1700..
I urge everyone dont buy this kind of trash from such kind of cheaters..."
836,1.0,"I really want to say that I am fed up with boat product and service, after few months careful usage Rockerz become handicapped.
When I went to service center they replaced with a refurbished,dealligned product.
It is a one day job for me to go service center with this traffic. The product worked for few hours till I reach home. When I charged the Rockerz I promise that It can replace my iron box. Finally Rockerz is not getting charged, the faulty product earlier atleast one side it was working fine. Hell with Nirwana.

I see that Overall One Year Replacement Warranty is a JUGAAD."
837,5.0,"Too good to have it in such price.. although it's too early to comment on every specs since I have bought this only 4 days back.
Till now no issue found and having gr8 experience. Sound quality superb, battery still not reached to half though have listened to music more than 5 hrs til now. Only problem is you will experience little ear pain if you put on the ear bud continuously more then an hrs time."
838,5.0,"Noise cancellation herein refers to outside noise being cancelled to the one who's hearing. While being on a call, if you try to speak something, your voice would be 20% & the outside voice would be 80%. Solution to this is taking the mic close to your mouth as you speak.

Otherwise, sound quality is 10/10."
839,2.0,"The bluetooth is really good for listening music. To use it for calling, you have to be in an isolated place so that the other person can hear you clearly. If you are in a public place or even at home it will capture all other sounds very loudly but not yours. Only buy if you are going to use it for listening to music. It will not disappoint you there. It has good bass, treble and vocals."
840,2.0,"People having Sony or other good earphones experience, don't go for it. You will not like it at all.

I am personally a Sony user, but after a long time I wanted to other brand. This is where I went wrong.

Honestly, people who don't have Sony experience can like(mentioning 'CAN') this earphone. But for those who love Sony sound, don't go for it."
841,4.0,Sound quality is good. But if you are in outdoor then it becomes noisy and people keep complaining that ambient sound is audible not my voice. Battery backup is okay if you don't use it continuously throughout the day. Bluetooth connectivity is good not the best because if phone is very near then it's okay or else it will create disturbance if you move to next room.
842,4.0,"Good sound quality. Crystal clear sound. The product is fit to the ears very exactly. Very good noise cancellation. Easy to commect via BT. Only problem faced ia its long cable when not fitted into ear. The cable is fit when used in the ear otherwise when hanging through the neck, its very longer"
843,5.0,Excellent product. I got it in lightning deal for 899. Worth at that price. Even it is worth to buy at 999. Sound quality is awesome. Bass is too good. Bluetooth connectivity is fast and no issue. I connected it to 2 devices simultaneously.
844,3.0,"Not good as boat wired earphones !!!!
Battery backup very low sudden decrease of charge level from 60% to 20% in 15 Minutes.
Not suitable as a travel gadget..
Very muc disappointment about the quality compared with wired one."
845,4.0,I am using this headphone for last 1 month. Really a good product in this price range. I have got this in 1000 rs in a sale. This headphone has good build quality and good quality sound. Only one problem is the mic. That dont have good range.
846,1.0,"Good product with high bass but sound is not that much crisp. But very confortable and charging fast and works around 5 hours and even more than that..

After 6 months

Stopped left ear and no service.. they do not pick up and seevice centre is too far.. repaired by own.. as wire damaged.. again after week wire damaged.

Bad quality of wire.. go for wired headphone."
847,4.0,"This is a semi rigid neck band with hanging wires from both ends. This was never mentioned in the description. Was looking for a full wire type earphones which can be conveniently carried in pocket. Long wires hanging down from tip of neck band reaches near ur umbilicus, kind of odd looking. Voice clarity is just ok. Clarity of the music is not exactly reproduced."
848,5.0,"Crispy and Immersive sound with top class built quality.. you will be fan of this bluetooth headset... Very nice design and flexible too for daily usage. After one charge it can last upto 3 days with 80% sound level and proper stand-by use.
I can surely tell you to go for it, value for money product from boat."
849,5.0," i got this product on time so delivery experience is good

sound quality is great 10/10
design is superb 10/10
bluetooth range 10 m this is not sufficient but ok
sweatproof earphone that is good thing so i am using this earphone in my gym.

packaging was good and one good thing is this earphone will come with 1 year warranty and little high in cost but if you're looking for rocking sound and best quality for your daily routine and workout so you can go ahead. i will surely recommend this earphone to everyone.."
850,5.0,"I'm writing this review after using the earphones for certain days. The sound quality is really good, you are able to hear the music & every details of it very clearly. Also it is of great use while on call, the sound is very clear. Noise cancellation of the earphones is fairly good. Overall a good product."
851,3.0,"It's almost perfect for me.
However, note that its not ok if you intend to use it while jogging or running. While jogging it keeps cutting off, and gives lots of noise. This was not indicated in the specifications.
Moreover, if you move 4/5 mtrs away from the phone, the sound will stop. This was not mentioned in the specifications."
852,4.0,"I bought this product for ₹999 in January. They sound really good and are very comfortable. With the right size ear tips, you can wear them for a long time. I used them in gym, while travelling and they performed as expected.
The battery will last 7-8 hrs easily. They charge from 0-100% in 2hrs. I was satisfied with them until I started having some issues recently like the greetings at time of power on/off stopped. The left side stopped working.
But as it was still under warrenty, I raised a ticket on boat site. Hoping to get a positive response.
I'll update their response
I got the replacement 15 days after the complaint."
853,4.0,"For music lovers
Bass music is awesome in this range
I tested with music like la calin for bass (kickass)
Melody : juga capablanca ( ok dokay),, O saathi re ( ok dokay)
EDM: KAMLESH audio addict ( kickass)
Nucleya (aaja). Kickass
It's basically good we go listen to bass and electronic genres. They sure will be a satisfied."
854,3.0,"I bought Boat wireless Bluetooth headset thisNovember 2019 onwards...First used boat Rockez worked good and I saw Battery heating problem in this product...
Except battery heat problem everything is good....

Some days gone...Ie 03.03.2020 Boat Rocket device battery failed...I am already posted review box that pics....Just i used normally 2/3 hours a day in 4 months used Boat Rockez device but now it is failed battery...

I want replacement this device becoz of one year warranty is there...I waiting for
The company how can respond....Giving replacement device"
855,2.0,"Sound is not that great... Wires are too long, feels awkward to use it outside ( other than workouts) due to long wires, especially the red one that i bought. Tried to return it but only replace option was available. So replaced it by asking for a different color.. But again received red colored one. But after getting replacement there was a retut option.. So returning it.. Only suted for work outs.. If u wants it for professional use like in office or Clients place, don't buy this one"
856,1.0,"Don't purchase this product , it is only show piece , nothing is there , no bass quality. No vocal , no sound quality , if you are planning to purchase this one its mean you are wasting your hard earning money. If you will think why i am not returning this product because last time i purchased boat 225 that one not working properly so i returned that and in turn they gave a check of duschat bank which is not is my city so conclusion is don't waste money in low product"
857,3.0,"It's bettery never reach to 100%, I recently observe this. The power hardly stands for 2-3 maximum if we are listening music. Worst case if we connect it to smart TV then it last only for 45minutes if it's 80% charged. Bad product. Don't buy it."
858,1.0,"Writing the review after 7 months use, the product worked fine initially but after 7 months of use it is not working. We don't pay that much amount for only 7 months use of any product. Warranty is still there but I live in small city, where to go and how to claim the warranty."
859,4.0,"Review as below in rating

First of all its A Bass Boosted Earphone.not natural sound
Built quality 4 /5......wires too thin......
Sound quality 4/5......It Has Lots Of Bass frequency.....
Bluetooth Connectivity 5/5... Cover more area without jerk
Battary 5/5

Pros... nice Bluetooth in this price range

Cons..... earphones wire too long hanging on neck it should be lil short as compare to other earphnes

This review by using 2/3 days..dnt knw abt long term.."
860,4.0,My 1st Bluetooth purchase from Amazon and like it very much. I was using it but some where I lost it 😔 but I really like it. I did not feel it's has some noise cancellation feature bcoz every time I am facing this issue. If I am talking to someone then I have switche off Bluetooth. But very soon I am going to order another one 😂 bcoz I am a music lover and I found Bluetooth headphones are best for my phone (OnePlus 7t).
861,1.0,"After using for 2 days when the battery got fully drained i kept it on chargin.
Now it doesnt turns on after chargin is disconnected.but it turns on and off while connected to charging.
Bad piece of hardware which couldnt stand for even 2 days.
Not a good experience for sure.
If others are facing the same donot buy!"
862,4.0,"After using it almost for a month, at times, hearing low battery notification kills me. Initially, I thought 6hrs of play time is enough for me. I will not mind recharging it every evening/night but in reality that does not happen..at least for me. Also, I don't push the earpieces very firmly for 100% noise cancellation. And then, I feel to increase volume and then the expression...uhh..already max :(
Overall, I liked it with above experiences time to time :|"
863,4.0,"Okay so i am writing the review for my rockerz after 7 months of incessant use. The battery life of this product is top notch while the sound quality is at par.The Bluetooth connectivity is good but the range is pretty modest. I got it for 999 and hence couldn't ve asked for more. That said, as with almost every other earphone, one said of it has malfunctioned exactly after 7 months of use. I was actually expecting it to last a year but nevertheless it's a good product for the economy and value for money segments."
864,5.0,"Got it within 24 hours from the time of Order. Great product, great sound.

As I purchased it for usage during bike riding, while riding little difficult to maintain the voice calls, because like other earphones, mic can't be placed near your mouth and opposite person will hear very low voice and other vehicle sound will be heard too high.
The strap has to be placed near the neck which is bit far from the mouth to reach out the voice.
Rest everything is wonderful and fine.

Go for it."
865,2.0,"I am writing this review after replacement headsets. First worked for few days then started playing up. Keeps disconnecting and breaks in between video plaly, audio play regardless online or offline. Today is the first day of replacement piece and it's ditto same, every few minutes keeps saying"" You are now connected to boatrockers"" and shows 100% battery available??? Amazing how on earth it can stay 100 % even after few hours usage? I am returning this back and would take refund and not replacement this time. It is very annoying exeperince."
866,4.0,"To be honest, I was expecting a great sound & bass quality just like we get in boAt Bass Superhead 225, but it is just okay.. I liked its amazing battery life and noise cancellation feature. I also feel that it should read out the numbers like 99999..... or the Caller's Name saved in the contacts for an incoming call rather than just 'Incoming call'"
867,4.0,This earphone is very good and very comfortable. Very good for bass lovers and noice cancellation is decent. I brought this for 999 so I think it is worth the price. But if you are not used to the rubber tip it has for not slipping from the ears then it is a little bit itchy sometimes but after we are used to it then its not a big problem.
868,1.0,This is not a product worth buying used for 2 days now returning.... While playing music there is some disturbance in between(like sssssssssss)... Sometimes buttons don't work and while playing pubg mic doesn't work... Mic quality is poor.... Fit is not good... While driving it started to get away in air... Sound quality is very poor while playing something on low volume... Sometimes feels noisy.... All in all only noise cancellation is good ...... Otherwise it is not worth buying never go for it.... Never.....
869,3.0,Wire length is large need to reduce it . And u can't find case to keep it.so Don't forgot to keep box with you.you are able to.listen very small sound.also louder in call l. Some times.while listening songs by keeping phone in pocket and moving sound getting distrurbed. My first one is not able to connect two devices at a time. After exchange I got right one .but still needs some improvements
870,4.0,"Build quality average. Plastic build and rubber finished product, not feels cheap.
Considering the price point, sound quality is awesome. Loud, crispy and vibrant. I purchased it in just Rs 999.
Battery backup is also good. 5-6 hrs average usage. BT range 25-30 ft.
Overall value for money product."
871,1.0,The product quality is so bad that it gave up with in 8 months . It doesn’t turn on inspite of full charge. Cheap Chinese product sold at very high price . Warranty services are also very poor and not efficient as against the tall claims .Nobody answers the call inspite of registering the complaint. Waiting for the replacement from last 12 days. I don’t know whether it will happen or not. Have decided not to buy or recommend any more boAt products henceforth.
872,1.0,"I had to gift this to my son.
Very disappointing to see the quality as the right ear buds has no sound.
It’s a faulty piece. I need a urgent replacement.
I was given a Retailers contact details but my mail bounced back and when i try calling the number, it says"" we are closed today"" . How come Saturday i got the same reply and today being a working day and monday, again the voice mail says "" we are closed today""... there is something wrong somewhere...
I need a help on priority as this kind of attitude is not accepted....."
873,1.0,"Earphone does have very low range connectivity. I don't think so it's noise cancellation have more than 20% capacity. After using it for some days it's speaker gave up and gives some very irritating sound.
When I tried to file a complaint on boat website for this then I saw that the product name is not there. What the heck? Even no call support without submitting the issue on website. I don't how am I suppose to contact submit the warranty claim if the website is not showing their own brand name of the product. Nice boat and Amazon. Keep it up in making customers fool. 😐😐"
874,5.0,"Awesome Bass 👌👌, Sound quality is good 👍..
Better Noise cancellation, It's water resistant, but not waterproof.
Battery🔋 Backup is Good nearly 6-7 hrs.
Value for Money. Build quality is Nice..
Overall Good Headset..

Thanks to Amazon for giving me Best price!!"
875,4.0,"Using for 6 months. Good battery life of 8 hrs. Sound quality is fine. Can be connected to two devices at a time. The buttons for forward and previous tracks doesn't work properly. If you are getting it for below 1500, go for it. Overall it's good."
876,3.0,"If you but this only for bass boosted sound,
Then thus is a good choice.
But all-over that's not a Worth of money.
Why???👇👇
-Built quality is very poor.
-so lenthy wires.
-connectivity issues on very short range.
-mic quality is very poor.
-all over you should spend 500 more and buy a JBL or any other bot."
877,1.0,"Please do not buy this product , my complaint number is 881765, in a month it stopped working, i returned it and when i got the replaced one the ear plugs were not fitted with the product, i raised a request for ear plug i got ear plug which does not go in to the socket. Imagine marketing which took the complaint even the image which i had sent with the email they didn't bother to check the size of the ear plug whether it will fit the device or not. Worst worst service, will never buy boat again n will recommend same to everyone who i meet."
878,2.0,"All is good and worth the money. But accessories are not available which is a huge drawback and pushes me to the edge for not recommending it. Ear hooks are not available online and are easily lost. Why not but something with a pattern available over the counter. That's why 2 star, other wise a good buy"
879,1.0,"The earphone's rubber hooks fall of easily.
Bluetooth stops connecting sometimes when I connect my phone and keep it in my pant pocket.
Right side speaker has stopped working completely.
The one star is also due to Amazon's service. My product is within the one year warranty period. However, to claim this warranty, I have to submit the Invoice which is not visible when I try to access it through the Amazon app, website or messages.
Wehn I click on 'view/print invoice', I get a message that says it is rush hour and traffic is piling up. Plz try again later.."
880,2.0,"Boat rokerz 255 is truly amazing in terms of sound quality and Bluetooth connectivity.
I ordered the earphones in January 19. It worked really well for 10 months. But one earphone stopped working because of loose connection in the cable from last month. I tried to register the complaint. It showed error. I tried calling the customer care many times. No one picked up the call. Very bad service. Product is under warranty. But no use."
881,4.0,"Packaging quality is superb... Thanks amazon
About product-
1. Sound Quality is mesmerize
2. Right earphone 's bass output quite less as compate to left.
3. Build quality is awesome and long lasting.
4. Easy to connect with device.
5. Neck design is superb and rest on neck with no issue.
6. Earbird are proper fit in ear not come out During running."
882,5.0,Awesomeee heaphone with high bass and noice cancellation up to the mark. Totally recomendable to thkse who likes high pitch musics with hard metal sounds. It is in affordable range and is better than any other bluetooth headphones of this price. Boat nirvana is giving this product as the best quality bluetooth headphone in the market with a playback time of 12 hrs.. You can easily take it on a day trip and even its charge will not drop out.
883,3.0,"the sound signature and product quality is above par in this price range, though the cable length is bit long. but if there is any issue and product is to be serviced during warranty period, then its a really different story altogether.
its been more than a month and i am yet to receive my serviced/replaced unit and i dont have any way to get any further update to my ticket and my unit. its strange that the customer care number and support email ids are there, but those are not monitored well it seems."
884,1.0,Very bed
885,4.0,"My first time using a wireless pair of headphones. It's truly convenient. I charge it every alternate day as I only used it approximately 4 hours a day. Especially conveniencnt when taking powerwalks, running or travelling by public transport. So far it's been a good experience."
886,4.0,"I always buy boat as my primary choice but on a specific day due to some extra offer prize I brought Nu Republic Bluetooth headset and then ordered boat for my brother after 2 weeks. But really guys Nu Republic Jaxx 3 provide provides better sound quality than boat.
In terms of bass and battery, boat is better as always."
887,1.0,"Bought this as it was recommended due to its value for money. After 3 months of use, one side stopped functioning. Got a replacement as it was under warranty. Now the replacement also has stopped working after 3-4 months of use. It is not charging hence I'm unable to use it. I'd recommend going for another Bluetooth earphones."
888,4.0,Have been using this for more than 2 months. Sound quality is good but still not the best. Its designed ergonomically. The ear buds are soft and comfortable. The Don't expect battery back up for more than a day. Value for money if the shelf life is more than 2 years
889,1.0,"Worst warranty service provider ever...after 4months of use left side speaker is not working. I claimed for replacement , they pick up my product bt after that there was no update. It is one month from the pick up date still not solve my issue. I search on Google and found very bad review against the company. There are many people who does not get their replacement till 3 months. Also their customer care contact no. Is not working. I am too much disappointed with their services.
Sound is good...bass also gd..best feature is connected with two devices at the same time."
890,5.0,It was my first wireless headset. sound quality is very good. ear bud is little bigger which is not comfortable when wearing helmets over this.
891,1.0,"Earphones stopped working in just 2 months and there's no way to contact Manufacturer for claiming warranty. You'll have a number where you'll speak with IVR automated call and it will send you an url which will throw you an error while raising compliant. The same thing applies to email support as well. They will send that URL in email reply. I've sent multiple emails till now, still not received any reply from them. BOAT is worst manufacturer and weird support. This is happening for the 2nd time for me"
892,1.0,"Its sound very inappropriate to say that but i was very happy with the product evrything the sound the noise cancellation the bluetooth connectivity evrything was fine . any one can go for the same for the reasonable price.
but but but
dont know the reason why its suddenly got dead . 1st time i got replaced the product but waited for somany days 15 - 20 days and get a new one and see again the same issue happened to me . dont know why after proper handling of the product again its dead. so if you are going to buy be prepared"
893,4.0,"Serves the purpose well! Sound quality is good though not equivalent to JBL wired headset. But still its worth the price! Got for ₹999 with additional 10%off over it.

Disadvantages:
1)Charge gradually drops from 100%-80% but then shows 80% for a long time though the charge is getting reduced and finally it drops to 60-40-20-0 within 5-10 minutes.
2)Not suitable while driving in 2-wheeler. (Connection gets dropped often while riding)"
894,4.0,"I just received 255
Sound nd bass awesome
Bluetooth range 10 mtrs.
Bill is not complete.Bill half-torn: If there is a problem in it, then there will be no problem in replacing it?
If it is kept in a mobile room, then its range is 10-12 feet when you go out.If the mobile is kept out and we are out: its range is 30 ft.
Received 4 earbuds.

It's my third boat product
1st boat car charger
2nd boat headphone
Nd 3rd rockerz 255."
895,1.0,"I give 1 star only because there is no option for 0 star,
I purchased Boat rockers from amazon, and it came with 1 year warranty, I have warranty card, amazon order number bill, and this wireless earphone is not functioning now, in just 2 month its stop working, so i want to claim my warranty card but when I drop a mail to boat rockers email id, there is no response, I call on phone number given on that warranty card, which is not a correct number, j drop msg to website, no assistance,

I felt cheated.... So guys don't trust Boat rockers 255 products...."
896,1.0,It was not working properly. Only one speak to works another is out of order. Very harsh sound very low quality sound. Bad product.
897,5.0,"Amazing product and the sound quality is the best. Talking about it's Mic, then if you are on a call, it becomes too noisy for a person who have called you. I disconnect it when I have to attend calls because noice cancellation is not that good. Overall the product is great and Bluetooth connectivity is great. Gets connected quickly."
898,4.0,"Got it at 900/- at a sale and it's a bang for the price. The Bluetooth connectivity is quite good and connects properly everytime. The range is around 10 metres and the sound distorts if you are in another room. The sound quality is okayish.. Neither too loud, nor too low. The disappointment is that the bass is flat. Don't know whether this defect is only on my device or for the entire range. Battery backup is around 4-5 hours. But will drain your phone's battery really fast. It's a really good deal for the price, but it is not that great!
Hit Like of this helped you.. Happy buying! ☺️"
899,4.0,"Amazing product ,

As per in pricing concern ,
,

Who is addicted to find bass quality sound in music , just go and buy this , this is the perfect for you.

Whenever you listen music every bit of every tone you can listen and feel that sound .

Battery performance:

Battery performance is also good , as per my usage while playing music , calling it's better .

Just go and buy this product."
900,3.0,"I am writing this review after using it for 2 months, Sound quality is good, not comfortable in ears, headphones are very lightweight that you couldn't wear this while driving at 60kmph, batry last for one day when fully charged, couldn't change the songs from control keys"
901,5.0,"Product is worth of cost ...
Excellent sound quality meets it's power .
Bluetooth connectivity is easy and fast.
Also easy to use bottons provided.
No problem with mic .
Cable length and neckband are accurate.
Charging and battery life is as good as spec.

Their is a noise when getting messages while playing music.
Charging port's cover/cap is not properly seated.

Just bought on 19th October 2019."
902,4.0,Bass is awesome... Loud speakers.. excellent connectivity... only disappoints at full volume..little noisy and not so happy experience in full-volume... but overall great product if compare with other brand... simply replacement of JBL products in less price.. you can consider it.. go for..
903,5.0,"I bought it for 999,I purchased it second time, gifted to my colleague. This is really good.
Sound quality is really good.
You can connect 2 devices at a time. I connect laptop and mobile both. when listening muaic on Lappy, if u get a call, it switches to mobile,this switch between device is not good but again in this price its awesome.
Battery stand by is 36 hours for me, and i have used it continuously for 8 hours in one go. So Battery life is pretty awesome.
Comfortable on ear."
904,5.0,"I am fan of mi sportz but there is noice cancellation issue while riding bike front person cant here any thing
Now i purchased
I used boat rokers RS 999 in offer

I suggest to buy bike riders its good call quality.i tested on 50km/hr also the front pserson here clearly

On bike several people want noice cancellation bluetooth head set so buy this one

Battery is around approx 6hr not checked in depth.

On Bike call receiving is easy thanks for boat."
905,2.0,Boat rockers 255 Sportz headset the sound is really good but what happened with in 2 months right speaker was not audible and the sound was too low and bluetooth connective also not upto the mark. In this it has mentioned it covers about 10mts but even 5mts you could hear the breakage of the voice. So my thing please don't buy and waste your money. Battery standby 6hrs if you continuously hear the video song or playing games. else only audio means 10hrs. But the bass sound is good. If you get the good one instead of defective piece then you can enjoy the nice music.
906,5.0,"The product is light and of great quality. The only bad thing about the product is that the long presses are too long almost 5 sec long. And when it turns on or off, it takes its time to announce 'youve tuned into boatrockers, you've tuned into Nirvana's and 'adios amego' while a blip would have done the job.

May be I am not as hip as the current generation.
Otherwise a great product and at a great price. I gifted one to my friend too."
907,2.0,boat customer care service is pathetic. My Bluetooth earphones stopped working within 3 Months. Replacement issued status is being displayed since 10 days and no updates since then. Won't get back to the customers by promising to do so when they are not able to answer the calls. Have been trying to call them everyday since last week
908,1.0,"Worst earphones Ever bought.
1. So much noise to another person if using for call
2. Pain in ear so can't use for long
3. Connectivity is too poor even cell in pocket and getting drops.
4. Overall don't go for it if you love comfort."
909,3.0,"bluetooth connectivity distance is merely 3-4 metres, finishing of the product is decent and satisfactory. Not too comfortable in the ear. Plugging in the charging cable is not so smooth, you have to press really hard but you need to be careful too as you might ruin the socket. Noise cancellation level is really low and is a irritating for the person on the receivers end. Good product if you want to use it in places with less external noise and just want to listen to music and don want to spend a lot on a bluetooth earphone set."
910,2.0,"Within three months of purchase of the item, the battery is dead and doesn't recharge at all. Bogus products being sold on Amazon these days. There seem to be no checks and balances in their system.
The product carries a replacement warranty of one year. Wonder whether Amazon will honour it???"
911,5.0,"We're using this product for a month now. It's really good. I was using Samsung level U but the wire snapped. This one is pocket friendly, flexible and worth buying. I went by Amazon choice and for the first month I'm really happy. Hopefully it works like this for a long time."
912,3.0,"Read this before you buy : Every time you connect these earphones to bluetooth, a guy SHOUTS in your ears at the top of his voice ""YOU ARE CONNECTED TO BOAT ROCKERS"". Boat is the worst company, who is advertising itself daily even after selling the product to customers by shouting into users ears daily. You did not give the ear phones to me for free. Then why do you think it's okay to shout your name in my ears daily a 100 times? REMOVE THE ****ING MESSAGE. BOAT IS THE WORST COMPANY WITH NO ETHICS."
913,5.0,"If you like bass than buy it superb bass but it's survive in low beats.
Overall it's best item and justify price.
By the way boat after sales service are damn good. If your earphone having any issue you need only log a complaint on website and upload proof of purchase they send courier person to pickup and they replace your earphone with sealed pack new within 10 days."
914,2.0,"After more than two months of usage i am reviewing this product.
It's third month and start creating problem. I mean bluetooth connectivity. Very low. Noice cancelation is also not upto mark.
Sound is good no doubt but lacking tow big things, durability and Bluetooth connectivity.
Noice cancellation not all up to the mark. Can say ""chal jayega"" type."
915,3.0,"<first hour review>

Phone call:
Poor voice quality on phone calls. Some bass kills the clarity in voice.

Music:
Inferior sound quality when listening to music.

Podcast:
Average performance. Unnecessary bass is spooling the podcast experience."
916,1.0,"Gives lot of disturbance while driving.
Also the bluetooth range is not good.
Gets paused while listening to music..
I want to return this product now but the window is closed. Also the retailer is not supportive.
I ordered 2 by mistake and wanted to return one.
I raised a request on the day I got the delivery. But did not get support from Amazon as well as the retailer."
917,1.0,"Everything is good but durability sucks and that means the product is really waste.
I have it since 2 months and one on side has already stopped working.
I wouldn't buy it again and you shouldn't buy it now"
918,5.0,Purchased almost 2 months used it roughly.....as mentioned it is sweat proof.....sometimes the conection breaks when mobile is in pocket but it is nor regular... Good bass and sound quality.....connects to 2 devices no connectivity issues.....battery lasting for almost 10 hours.....happy with the device
919,1.0,"I have received this headphone. Honest feedback - Don't buy it. Reason being - It causes headache because of the magnet used in it. From the morning I have used it thrice, after 15-20 minutes of usage my head starts to pain and when I keep it aside my head becomes normal. I am going to consumer forum to complaint and Lodge a FIR against boat as this earphone is hazardous for health and it's quiet evident. Won't take much to prove them guilt. Please don't buy it, for your health it's hazardous."
920,3.0,"Sound quality is good.
Sometime there is connectivity issue when you keep your phone in your pant. And battery back up is not that good compare to other brands.... If you need anything detials comment me , I will reply
I have bought noise wireless its better than boat rockerz 255 sport edition"
921,1.0,"AMAZON IS USELESS, KNOW I PURCHASE FROM FLIPKART, THEY ARE MORE BETTER IN THIS REGARD, THIS PRODUCT IS NOT WORKING I NEED A REPLACEMENT, I PURCHASED THIS ITEM AND IT WORKED FOR ONLY TWO DAYS, I SENT FOR WARRANTY AND THEY REPLACED ME WITH OTHER USED EARPHONE , BUT AGAIN THE EARPHONE IS NOT CHARGING ,
REALLY USELESS PRODUCT, A"
922,4.0,"This product is fantastic...it's got amazing quality sound and bass, clear and sharp microphone sound delivery, light weight and easy to handle. Voice guidance feature is cool.

3 months down the line, it's started giving a bit of issues, disturbance issue via Microphone of the headset.

Since it is a 1 year warranty product, in process of contacting for Warranty Support.

I am loving it.

Worth purchasing this headset."
923,3.0,"Product appearance was different from website. There is no proper packaging.
Otherwise product is good. Sound is very clear."
924,4.0,"The product is good.
Sound is almost acceptable at the price
Good bass though
Noise cancellation is decent
The eartips are not that comfortable for long time use
Battery last about 3 days as per my usage of daily 3-4 hours of use
Built quality and design is good
Love the magnet concept, helps to keep the earphones in place
They could have added the pause feature if possible
If you get a good deal go for it"
925,4.0,"Earphone is awesome, quality is superb, sound,bass, connectivity is super good , overall i loved it .
Packaging was so pooorrrr.... Terrible😖, outside box is totally broken, there is no bubble wrapping for this delicate kind of item, this is totally disgusting work done by seller, please improve your packaging...."
926,4.0,"Received in a unsatisfying packaging which seemed like a duplicate product. Still not sure about it's originality. However, sound quality is good and battery backup is also pretty good.

Quality wise it is fine considering the period I have used it. Can't comment upon the durability etc as of now."
927,1.0,"This earphones is worst thing you can get.
It just works awesome for few days but after a month my earphone's right speaker are not working...
Not worth of money..
And customer service is also worse. They will not care about you.
Please don't buy it."
928,1.0,"I purchased these earphones on 6 February 2019. It worked great until now. I used it regularly and it gave me 8-10 hours of battery life. Since the last 3-4 days, I am facing the charging issue. It is getting discharged only after 30-45 minutes of playing even though I charge it for more than 1 hour.

Update: I reported a complaint with Boat and got a replacement product after around 15 days. The new products stopped charging after around 15 days. Very unreliable and disappointing. I have sent them an email regarding this and still waiting to hear."
929,5.0,"Superb quality wireless earphone ever used, best sound quality to listen music,voice calling and noise cancellation is also perfact.Fits perfact in ear and suoerb battery life for fullday use.The only one thing i didn't like is loose rubber support, it can be lost easly at anywher."
930,3.0,"No doubt about sound quality. Majour concern is battery backup, it won't come 3-4 hrs. Magic stuff is battery level will be showing as 20% and we will get voice alert too but it will get turned off immediately. It's not auggestable for those who are looking for long battery life."
931,4.0,"Have been using for a month in gym and day to day whatsapp calls. Works well if you are charging on a laptop. Dont plag directly mobile chargers as most of the headphones are not able to handle the power.
Quality is just OK, but will do the job."
932,1.0,"I don't even care about anything else if sound quality is below par.
I've used many Boat wired earphones and they're decent. Too loud bass always but still you can hear highs and lows and mids fairly clear. This one has just so much bass there's almost 0 clarity."
933,5.0,"I m giving my review after using one month.. This is simply Awesome product..
* Built quality is very good.
* Clear sound and heavy bass amazing. sound quality and no sound disturb noise.
* Battery life is superb more than 24hrs with use of songs and games.
* Super fast connection with the mobile.

Overall great product. Recommended to all who want to buy Bluetooth headset. And please ignore negative reviews because it is a very good product in this price range."
934,5.0,"Bass is VERY good. I love bass and this has powerful driver that can handle some bass. Battery backup is very good. Range isn't great, noise cancellation is ok. But all that gets forgotten when bass hits. I have become a fan of boat audio. These are so worth the 2 gandhiji notes I paid for these. Warranty is cool too.
Also, do not go for Boult ones. These sound way way better than those."
935,1.0,"I want to return the item and take back my money.
It is purely cheating to the customer . Nowhere it is mentioned that only replacement .
There is no return available and only replace .Item is too junk and does not hold any charge."
936,3.0,"Pros
1.The bass is good but it loses on CLARITY...
2.Light weight...convenient to use
3. Battery life is adequate 5-6hrs on normal usage on 60-70% volume
4. Price....at 810 after all the offers... it's the best BEST bluetooth earphone at this price.
Cons
1. Bluetooth connectivity is not that great....as I move from one room to another
2. Quality of the sound is not that great....volume is little low... even at the highest... but if you need only bass from your phone.... then Its ok..."
937,4.0,"I've bought this product. For the music lovers it is really 👌. It has good noice cancellation and the mic works great but the only drawback is that the music doesn't stops even though the ear buds are connected with their magents inbuoit in it. Apart from it the bass, noice cancellation, mic and the battery🔋 backup everything is good and it is affordable price."
938,4.0,"After using it for more than a month, please read the below points:
PROS:
1. BASS LOVERS gonna love it big time.
2. SOUND CLARITY definitely very Good.
3. CONTROLS: Space on the earphone are very well utilized for Volume controls, forward and reverse."
939,4.0,"Comfortable to wear and extremely simple to set up. Got a funky feel to the brand. I feel the sound has a higher bass tone, which can’t be adjusted. Battery life while on calls should be better. That said, this set is really growing on me and worth the price (1.8k)"
940,5.0,"For this price, its worth it.
Inuse it for my laptop zoom calls mostly. Stays for max of one day if u are in meetings for a total of 5-6 hours. Dual connectivity is ok-ish.

Overall- You can go for it. Worth the money"
941,4.0,"This Boat Rockerz 255 is my first Purchase of Bluetooth Headphone and I found this better in terms of Sound performance than JBL C200Si and Sennheiser MX 170 which I have been using for quite some time. The Bass is very immersive and Lows / Mid are crystal clear. Treble is controlled and is balanced. This Boat Rockerz 255 beats the JBL & Sennheiser wired headphones that cost around Rs. 800-900. AT Boat Rockerz @ Rs.899/- is a great deal. Must buy, Boat Rocks......"
942,5.0,I like the build quality of this product and the battery life is awesome and while doing workout comfortness is good but I felt sound quality is not upto the mark while comparing out boat with wire headsets like 225 only thing is the Boss is not that much good other than that awesome awesome product I got a good deal
943,1.0,Noice cancellation is not there. On call only background sound is hearing and not the persons voice. So much of distortion in voice to the opponent on call. And treble is more than base. Treble and base balance is not there. I brought it with full expectations to gift it but disappointed very badly. You can not make phone call if you are in outside. Worst product seriously. : (
944,1.0,This is the worst product which I purchased it was not working and wasn't connecting to any device bcoz red and blue both light used to blink.. I raised a complaint and they took for replacement and said replacement done and sent the same product by doing neat polish .after replacement also not working trying to reach boad customer care but no response.. don't by this product..
945,2.0,"It says it can connect to two devices, but, it does not. You have to disconnect from first to connect to second. And then it takes too much time/tries to connect to the second one. It also lags if u connect it to laptop and watch Netflix, if you jump 10 minutes ahead, the voice quality deteriorates heavily.Sound quality is okayish. Got it at 999, still returned it."
946,5.0,"Good product. Easy to use. Good sound quality although I use it mainly for audiobooks so bass effect is not a concern to me. Not much of noise cancellation actually but would give good volumes even in noisy areas.
It issue is it starts to become uncomfortable after about an hour of use. My daily usage is close to 2 hours and I've used a lot of in the ear type headphones.
Bottom line. Definitely worth the money."
947,1.0,The product stopped working within 4 months they won't connect to any device I've tried multiple devices and multiple fixes. Now they're absolutely unusable. The same thing happened to my boat rockerz 510. The customer support is hot garbage. The service center never picks up the phone and there is no online RMA procedure 0/10 would never buy from boat again. Don't let the price tag or features fool you it's all gonna break down in the end.
948,5.0,"It was a nice product. Good Sound Quality and all. but Started malfunctioning when calling. Sounds from d caller get distorted and cant understand at all.. It still working good in otherwise like Audio Video playing from phone..

I hav just registered a compalint in d support site (Tocket No : 421323)

Hope it will get resolved soon and I can make it a 5 star then..

Update : Product got replaced and new one works up to expectations.. thanks for the support.."

The call quality is disappointing. The inbuilt mic is not that great. The other person's voice that we hear during a call is also slightly distorted when compared with the call without Bluetooth earphones.

Over all build quality is good."
951,3.0,"Got the earphones 3 days back. As with other boAt earphones the sound quality including bass is really good, but the background noise cancellation is not good. When i am talking on phone, the quality of sound heard by the person on the other side is not good with lot of background noise from my side, which doesnot happen with wired earphones or talking without earphones. Battery backup till now is good. No other issues."
952,4.0,"It's very comfortable in the ear. The sound quality is good..but the bass is pretty good. Ideal for jogging.but sometimes the band my get in the way. When you are wearing it on your neck it is super long and doesn't look that great. The magnets are fine, not super strong but not bad at all.the best part is the ear support which helps a lot cuz generally they never stay in my ear but now it never falls."
953,4.0,"The earphones are really good in terms of sound quality,bass and noise cancellation. The battery in this earphones is pretty decent. The only thing I didn't like is the battery indicator. When the battery is at 40% and it suddenly drops to 20%. After 1-2 minutes the voice assistant gives two warnings and the earphones shut down. From 40 to 0 battery drops down really quick which I feel is not accurate."
954,4.0,The product is quite decent for the price and is very convenient to use. It's Bluetoothconnectivity is limited to a few meters after which it gets automatically disconnected. It lasts for about 5 to 6 hours but u need to turn off the headphone manually and it is not automatically turned off like the MI headphone when u stick the magnetic headphone together.
955,1.0,"Very worst product kachara real
Cannot hear voice but only can hear sound
When the call comes the mobile rings
When I play games the game starts
When I do shopping it open the sites
It is the worst product ever experienced

Don't give me good percentage in school
I am failed in every class test and every exam
It doesn't give me iphone1928
(When ever it comes)
Worst please don't take it and give the amount to me and I will have some money
And
You whoever is reading it *********really"
956,3.0,"I wanted something to replace my TomTom's bluetooth ear phones (ah, how I miss them). While the sound quality is way better then what I derived from TomTom's original set, but boat Rockerz are heavy, bouncy and needs your attention all the time while running. The heavy arms are probably the reason for delivering the sound quality and longer battery life, but they surely are not for runners."
957,3.0,"1.Noise cancellation is good.
2.connectivity is poor when i call sometimes its sound is broken.bluetooth 4.2 is outdated its not work in havy wireless noise area i prefer blt 5.0. for room is good
3.Price is value for money i got it ₹899 in bbd.
4.This price range sound quality is good but not aowsem because i used before boat 220 wired (₹500) its base is better than it."
958,1.0,"Product is superb, but after 4 months of normal use right side ear piece stopped working.

I tried to contact Boat Service Centre in Chennai for a replacement, they rejected my request because they can assure replacement warranty only for manufacturing defects. Then why Boat provides such a 1 year replacement warranty.

My device is in the same condition how I received it. No water or moisture contact, No breakage of the body or wire parts."
959,3.0,"It is good value for money. Connects very well and no issues. But sound quality is not that great to listen music. It does not comes close to samsung earphones. But sound quality for speaking is good.
If music is your priority, go for other earphone, else buy this."
960,2.0,"I received it yesterday, as I wanted a wireless earphones. Quality of sound is just disappointing, so much of bass, it masks all the finer tunes. I am using Sound magic E10c, which in terms of sound quality way ahead of this product. I purchased it in 1199/- in sale (these sales are just selling gimmick,I knew BoAt is just a branding on chinese stuffs like micromax, they can sell their item only on e plateform, still I thought to give it a try."
961,2.0,"After 9 months of use, battery discharges instantly when taken off charge, making product unusable. Tried to register complaint, as product was within warranty period. Number does not work, website has no proper channel for accepting replacement requests. Seems it's kept deliberately that way. And mine is not an isolated case.

Good sound quality and build at this price, but guess it all comes at the cost of longevity. Definitely not worth it if you are looking for earphones that last more than a year."
962,4.0,"Everything is ok... And when we travel on bike it come off from our neck that's the drawback and some noise heard when we talk on phone. Connection is good, sound quality is good compared to this boat earphones are much more better."
963,4.0,I have used a couple of budget wireless earphones in my life and this is by far the best one. The sound quality is just too good for the price. Noise cancellation is just average. The sound stage is definitely on the base heavy side but not too basey. There isn't much loss in sound quality when increasing the volume. On the whole this is a really good earphone and a amazing deal. I recommend this to anyone trying to but their first pair of wireless earphones.
964,4.0,"Using it since last 4 months, I love it. I'll recommend it to buy.

Good Bluetooth connectivity. Good Battery Life. Good Sounds. That's why I bought it.

BUT ... The manufacturer should provide extra ear supports and supporting buds."
965,1.0,It's good for music and not good for receiving calls. First few weeks it was working fine but after that when I receive call the voice is wobbling and u can't hear other person properly. Then I have to disconnect the Bluetooth and heart from phone only. Seem waste of money.
966,2.0,"Using this headphones from 5-6 days and found below issues.
1. Battery life is too poor, while using it shows 100% battery but while using battery drained out in 15-20 minutes
2. Automatically disconnection of headphone while connected with phone.
3. Ears are paining while using the headphones 1 hour or so.
4. Battery discharge very quickly.
5. While plugin to charge when its 0%, it started showing 100% charged in 15 minutes, that's a CRAP.

I have now returned the product back to the seller and call for a replacement. So, its better to be move towards SONY, JBL or Sennheiser Headphones."
967,3.0,Not very gud product...it gets disconnected from bluetooth automatically n whn its charging get exhausted thn also it shows 80% battery remaining all the time..which is very confusing..several time its pairing also disconnected at any point of time
968,1.0,"Never buy anything from boat, their after sale service is pathetic. My earphones button stopped functioning one month after purchase. I've reverse shipped it under warranty claim of my product. Its been over a month since I've shipped it. No response and their customer care number also doesn't work, no representative is available at any time. Better spend some bucks and buy good quality earphones whose after sale service is also good."
969,2.0,"I have bought this on October first week sale to gift my cousin, the sound quality is not at all upto the mark.
I have tested it with all type of songs and sounds where i got a conclusion that noise cancellation is good but due to the bass the ear drums shall get affected if we listen the music at loud volume.
However the bluetooth connectivity has also been a problem i.e., while travelling it gets disconnected atleast once."
970,4.0,"It's actually a good earphones... At legitimate price... Bought for 999. Battery good. Sound good, Good base, Comfert good. What I diskiled is, sound cracks when phone kept in back pocket or swinging hands while walking."
971,4.0,"Writing after use of 10 months...
Sound quality 8/10
Bulid 8.5/10
Comfort 7/10
Battery 6/10
Looks 8/10
Mic 7.5/10
Durability 8/10

Overall a very satisfying product under ₹1k"
972,4.0,Good but keeps disconnecting sometimes when the phone is in my pocket. Also option to navigate through the songs is limited. Also not sure if the product delivered was a 2nd hand one judging by the package condition. I think better to buy from shop after inspection of seal and every thing.
973,4.0,"+
Great battery life
Good sound quality
No need to listen at 85+ volume level since sou d isolaiis good

-
Don't fit perfectly in ear
sometimes and are falling off multiple times in case of going over bad roads

Overall value for money, go ahead and buy !"
974,1.0,"Not worth it... This was my first purchase from mi, and its not worth all the hype that has been created in the market.
Overall build quality looked cheap, performance was average. The biggest con is connectivity and battery backup.
Go for slightly higher price range and look for a better brand."
975,4.0,The earphones are the best bassheads you can find at such a low budget. Sometimes the bass is so much that the sound quality is compromised. You literally can't listen at max volume on both you phone and earphones. The controls however are very friendly and also the earphones are pretty light weight. Connection issues haven't yet ever surfaced and it's been 4 weeks I am using the earphones and also 2 devices can connect simultaneously.
976,5.0,"It was delivered yesterday to me and I'm writing this review after 1 day use and trust me i purchased many things but I'm writting review of product first time because it impressed me lot. The sound quality is really awesome and battery is pretty good backup and noise cancellation is also good but the best part of this product is range according to quality is nothing.
If you are confusing to buy in compare to same range or under 2k then be practical this one is going to be best choice for you. I got this in 1200 on time of sale. Thanqu"
977,5.0,"I purchased two wireless earphones simultaneously, Boat RockerZ 255 and MI basic wireless earphones. After using both for a week, I found that:
1. Boat RockerZ 255 is comparatively higher on bass and sound quality.
2. MI has a better battery longevity.
3. Boat RockerZ has a more sturdy built.
4. MI is easier and much lighter to move around with.
I use either as per my need."
978,5.0,"Crystal clear sound and good battery backup. Very much useful while traveling by two-wheeler. You can connect with the phone via BlueTooth, just insert the earbuds, wear your helmet travel without tension. The speech very audible even while traveling. Thanks to boAt Rockerz 255"
979,5.0,M loving it... Exactly what i needed... Free from wire de-tangling process... Even previously i had boat and was totally satisfied with the after sales service apart from few follow ups to get the product registered...
980,2.0,"The earphone is fine. The wire is way too long which is annoying during worouts. The wire at the neck is way too thick. Seems like wearing a hairband around the neck. I do not like it for that reason. It will just keep shifting from one side to another and will distract you during workouts.
Dound quality is good. However, the bluetooth range is not so good. It starts to disconnectent while moving in the gym from one side another."
981,1.0,Not a good earphone at all. Waste of money.... The product did not even give me a month of proper usage .....the Bluetooth automatically disconnects. The sound quality too is very poor.... In all do not even think of buying this product.
982,4.0,"Great earphone in sound and built quality but not that good in range. Sound quality is great, even earphone is balanced and stays back in your neck. Battery is also good as I've never counted on timer but yes more than 6 hrs. Earphone can run whole day or single charge. Butto s are good and all functional as told.
Mic is too sensitive even small pin drop in room feels like loud sound to person on other side of call.

I found only range and mic sensitivity issue, even sometimes sound lags when device is in your hand or pocket.

I returned it on these 2 factors only, rest are good."
983,5.0,"good quality light weight . Long battery backup. So far I have used this for more than 20 days, I have not faced any battery issues. If you use only to answer the call then u will get 8hrs approx backup and music backup may vary as per ur usage. Very good sound quality. This is my second Bluetooth headset"
984,3.0,"It's my first review after using my product for 30 minutes

Excellent sound system and flexibility is awesome.

It worked 11 months without single issue but 5 days back it stopped working applied warranty need to check outcome

Will give battery and full review after a week utilisation

Note: if u listen with full sound in this headset it may spoil your hearing capability less volume in the headset itself had good quality."
985,1.0,"Sound is not at all balanced. Bass is too loud... All other frequencies are being dominated. Bass is loud but doesn't have quality. Not worth spending 1500/-. Built quality is also decent.

I have to tweak Equalizer a lot to get a balance of all frequencies. That's not all... Equalizer need to be changed each time for different types of songs. I am not at all happy to buy this. Wastee of money. I could have added some more amount and should have bought some good brand."
986,5.0,Sound is better than most of the other brands out there (In same price range). Bass is fine and noise cancellation is pretty good. Mic is not upto the mark as sometimes other side can't hear my voice. Overall it's a value for money deal.
987,5.0,"Superb product. Sound quality is impressive. It cancels out the bad sounds perfectly. Very easy to connect to any device. Compatable for android or smart tv also along with android, apple, windows devices also. Sound quality remains same even after 6-7 years. I would highly recommend this product."
988,4.0,Sound is very good.....but i think their is a design issue which make it not fit in ear properly.... that's why one can't experience the bass properly if not tightly pushed in. Battery life is suprb upto 6 hours and charging time 1.5 hrs. But due to metal finishing in winter it becomes very cold and hurts the ears. The summer u can think....Its a nice purchase for listening music but some designing faults i can see that's it.
989,3.0,Good product but the sound quality is average. You can make out the difference in the sound that you hear. Overall good product but would prefer a product with better sound. We should get an option to test the sound quality and then buy
990,5.0,"Im a kind of headset freak, was already having bunch of wired headsets and few wireless as well. I must say that by 2k u wont get any better product than this.

In all perspective be it as bttery capacity, sound clarity, when taking calls I believe it out performs all the other BT earphones atleast in 2k budgeted earphones.

Have a collection of BOAT branded earphones & wireless speakers, from that experience i can honestly say that BOAT never disappoints u."
991,4.0,"Pros:
Nice Noise cancellation for a bt at the price
Magnetic eartips
Call quality is good with noise calculation
Nice bass for a bt headset at the price
Pretty convenient while commuting because it's a bt headset
Cons:
If u r thinking about playing Pubg on it, then forget it. It's mic doesn't work with Pubg and voice is very low.
Not the best sound quality at 1500 because it's a Bluetooth headset
Ok battery life
Wires slightly longer than what's convenient"
992,1.0,"Dear Team,

993,4.0,I bought this for 999 during prime day sale.. want to bug another one but not getting with the same price.. although waiting for it to come down.. if y are thinking to take a Bluetooth headset here it is.. worth more than the money paid for..
994,4.0,"*Sound is very clear, definitely you'll love
enjoying
music.
*Mic is also awesome, with in 10-15 metre
range
there is no disturbance.
*For this price it is worth buying
*Since the earphone is in the ear type, first
time
users may feel little bit discomfort while
initial using
but later you will get used to it.

Good sound quality 8/10
Awesome bass 10/10
Decent battery life 7.5/10
Build and design 9/10
Worth the price 10/10
Overall 9/10"
995,1.0,"Very bad. Once I go to a bit distance on the other room, it starts making too much noise and even after to a close position still it continues to making the sound. And hence everytime need to disconnect the call and retry again."
996,1.0,"we used this product only 4 month, after that one side not working, and i claimed warranty they collect my product immediately 7 month over still i didn't receive the product.
better don't buy this product, because my friend also facing same issue.
i didn't expect this type of service provided by boAt.
Worst service, while we try to call the customer service and believe me we wait 3 hrs to contact the customer servicer but no one listening to our issue.
we have lot to complain about it but this is not a right place."
997,4.0,"Its a great product in the 1000/- segment (bought in offer).

Over 10 pieces bought in my circle.

Comfortable, durable, long battery, fits.

Over all a Good product.

32 hrs of battery with single device.
With Multiple device around 18 hrs

Litte drop in voice Quality while connected via Skype and microsoft teams"
998,5.0,"It is awesome at high!!

Lows and Mids not clear at low volume. But at high you will be ""Only in your own World"" +++

Gets connected automatically once paired. Fits well, good while running or gym.

Best purchase below 1000. One more thing that pushed me to buy this apart from price is ONE YEAR REPLACEMENT WARRANTY. Wow!! What else can you ask for 1k? Go for it, if you're aiming to buy Neckband below 1250/-"
999,3.0,"Used for 3weeks now , good sound quality for few days . After that some noises began occasionally, thought it was some glitch at that time . But now it's frequently occuring , since my Return window closed , i can't able to return the product. got stuck now . Never experienced Boat product like this . Worst buy for me ."
1000,4.0,I have been using wired earphones from Boat earlier so when I decided to get Bluetooth earphones my obvious choice was Boat. The earphones are worth the money and the sound quality is good but I still feel they are not as good as the wired ones.
1001,4.0,"i bought itfor 999,I purchased it second time, gifted first one to brother. This is really good.
Sound quality is really good.
You can connect 2 devices at a time.I connect laptop and mobile both.when listening music on Lappy, if u get a call, it switches to mobile,this switch between device is not good but again in this price its awesome.
Battery stand by is 36 hours for me, and i have used it contiguously for 8 hours in one go. So Battery life is pretty awesome.
Comfortable on ear."
1002,3.0,"Battery backup is average.
You cannot connect it during charging.
Charging time is very less.
There is no way to listen it in low battery, every two to three seconds, voice comes up to notify you the battery status.
But overall a good product, 3.4/5 stars."
1003,1.0,The picture gives an impression that it is all soft wire but one half of it is ugly hard plastic. Unrealistic picture! Wasted my money. I could have put another 300 rs and bought a JBL wireless earphone that's all soft wire!
1004,4.0,"I have used wired oneplus bullet compared to that this wireless earphone feels low...but considering the price, this Bluetooth are best in it's category.

* Sound output is good
* Must have earphone for bass lover

The only this I feel uncomfortable with this earphone is that if used for long time, you will feel pain in ears..."
1005,5.0,"Its a brilliant earphone! The audio is crisp, clear with thumping bass. Fits well in the neck and gets connected in a sec too. The Neon color adds some style to it. It came in a nice box with accessories and manuals. Boat never disappoints!"
1006,2.0,I bought the product on 12th August .it was a great product . the sound quality was great the base was good I had little issues with the connectivity but not that much. But now after 6 months one side of the earphone is not working I don't know why but that's really frustrating as the company claims 1 year warranty . In my opinion the design is not that great and the build quality is just 3 out of 5.so if you are planning to buy this please take care of this and do not put it in your bag or something like that as it may get damaged
1007,5.0,"Best wireless ear phones at this price bracket.
Will give you 3.5 hours of on time.
15 minutes of charge will give you atleast 1 hour.
Sound is normal don't expect much at this price bracket.
All functionally working as they have mentioned. Except below
Don't try to connect with multiple devices otherwise this will surely hang or doing some strange behavior."
1008,1.0,"Too many errors at the same time, connectivity problem including not connecting to my other devices,sometimes when connected to my device it only sends commands like Play pause to device and sound not coming from earphone. In terms of sound quality it's good for beat clearance but not for good base.
Worse battery backup.It says 6 hrs. Average battery backup but 2 days old earphone have 4-5 hrs of backup.
Giving a star only for sound quality nothing is good in this other than sound quality."
1009,5.0,"I am surprised by negative reviews but I am extremely happy about the build quality, design and sound quality.
Of course I am just using it for 1 day now. I will update again if needed. I hope I won't have to!
Note: I bought it for 1999 and in 2 days the price dropped by 500. Now they are selling it for 1499. :-("
1010,1.0,"Not a good product at all. Mic don’t work well picks up entire surround noise . Battery life is sick hardly gives 3-4 hrs of play time.
I opted for a exchange of the product, it didn’t get delivered at all. After following up on exchange for a week. Amazon customer service says that it is damaged in transit after the repeated followup, the replacement was still in cargo yard and none delivered it and updated as they wanted."
1011,5.0,"Packaging was good. This is my second bluetooth eargear purchase. First was many years ago and was always reluctant to buy them again, but this one proves to be best buy. Sound quality is upto the mark for the price paid. It was actually more than what i have expected. Thanks Amazon for getting this product. Thanks again."
1012,3.0,"I did not like the sound of the device too much (bass is not too much as the other reviews claim). Mine had problems connecting to multiple devices, I had to switch it off and then switch it on everytime I want some it to connect to multiple devices. Battery backup is only about 5 hours"
1013,5.0,What an amazing Bluetooth wireless earphone. I riding my bike with 100km/h but noise cancellation is just amazing sounds clearly hear in that speed and neck band also fabulous in that speed neck band not flow in wind. Bass quality is like I am hearing it in my boat Bluetooth headphone. Boat you are just amazing. Battery life is also good. I love it.
1014,5.0,"Good one to buy at this cost.
When the battery level is ~20%, Bluetooth connectivity becomes issue. But, battery lasts long and so I faced this issue only twice in past 4 months of usage.
Bass is reasonable."
1015,4.0,The base is excellent. Sound is clear. Battery life is good. It usually sells around 1500 rupees but I got it for 1000 rupees at that price it's very very good but if it's around 1500 rupees than I would suggest to go with realme wireless which sells around 1800 and for 300 more you are getting more features and similar sound and better battery and connectivity. But if you can get it for 1000-1100 it's best.
1016,1.0,The original boat-rockers 255 I have experienced from my friend was good. But the received item I received is different from the original. The USB charging port cover is not fixing properly and it has a sharp projection than makes discomfort while wearing. But the original one has a sap fit design and has no projection after insertions. I have uploaded 2 photos of the received item and the original for your ready reference. The sound quality also not as good as in the original. I request for a replacement providing a good one.
1017,4.0,"Cool earphone It can cover 3 to 5 meeter range and earbuds are good take the shape of inner ear but earplugs which are fitted in ear have loosed and sometimes come out from buds so I have to very carefull about it. If it missed then it wouldn't get replacement and your earphone will go in trash This is only problem with it otherwise sound quality,look,fitting in any type ear and bass are awesome....
Have a Good.......:-)"
1018,4.0,"1.Sound Quality:-
Bass is enough to enjoy music. But lack of clearity .It is better than BaultAudio wireless. But in this price it is aswme.
4.8/5
2. Noise cancellation:-
Good and premium quality ears buds. If you use it long time, the sporty style of extensions can feel some pain in ear.
3.8/5
3. Bluetooth Connectivity:-
As per description, it maintains 3M distance.
4.8/5
4. Water resistant:-
Don't use during rainy season. It is water resistant not pure waterproof.

1019,1.0,"If you are a constant user then don't buy this product as it built quality is not so good within 7 months my headphone's one ear piece stopped working due to loose connection. The bass is good and the treble and highs are not so good enough it's not good for vocals. It can get pretty loud tho...! I have also experience while kept in my pocket the audio gets cut not often but sometimes but its good for calling And I also experience one problem with this that while playing PUBG the mic was not working at all that was weird i try alot of thing but it didn't activated it's mic ;-(
Noise cancellation is good blue connectivity is ok but regret now after buying this headset as its one ear piece stop working!"
1020,4.0,"Straight to the point...

Bass - No problem...
Sound - Decent sound...Vocals no problem...Treble somewhat...
Mic - Ok/Average
Comfort - So much Better than 225(wired), which was soooo uncomfortable
Build quality - Good but definitely not for rough use...
Charging - came with 100%...Charging port is somewhat tight...Rubber opening make you tensed...

Overall a Decent/Good product but only under 1K price !! So look for Deals👍"
1021,4.0,"I am a gym person.
Sweat no issue.
It's just that while skipping it tends to
Go here and there and same is the issue with bench press.
Though headphones are well built but tend to move here and there if u workout rigrously.
Sound- just for bass lovers
Noise cancellation- all most okay but not good as Sennheiser
Moisture you won't find any issues
Should you buy it?
Yes at this price range
Your getting best of every feature so it doesn't hurt much"
1022,5.0,"Actually I used it almost for 3 months where I feel it's better Time to review
Battery back is awesome as mentioned
Bass is super
Sound quality is good
Noise cancellation is good
It's also can be wearable when jogging or at the time of exercise there is no tension of falling from ears which I feel so better

For these reasons I'm so satisfied with the product and cost
I bought it for Rs 1500/-"
1023,5.0,"Literally best blutooth earphone under this price range i got this for 999 only. The sound quality was awsom, Base is too good, pairing with mobile is also very easy, call quality is also very nice & works upto 30 feets from smartphone noice cancellation is ok, the earlock is also soft and can be removable. In my openion just go for it if you are getting it under 1000👍🔥🔥"
1024,5.0,Sound quality is awesome...very comfortable to use...battery life is also good enough...easy connectivity...battery percentage can be seen on mobile screen thats the thing i liked the most ... overall its a great product from boat....go for it...
1025,5.0,It's been a month now I am using this earphone. Since day one I am getting almost 10hours of playtime in full charge and there is no lagging in sound too. The bass is good enough. There is no connection loss at all.. worth a buy
1026,1.0,"Sound Quality is good, product quality is good, but disappointed with the battery. With 60%-70% volume, it hardly works for 3 hours, this is very bad considering the brand."
1027,4.0,"The Quality of music you listen is OK. If you are looking for a cheapest and good bluetooth headset with mic for receiving calls and listening music this might be the one. The battery life is also good. Look wise is stylish, I have the red one. If you want to hear only music and need a cheaper one I will recommend go for a wired one Sennheiser CX 180. There are many others if you have money to spend ;-) ."
1028,3.0,"Sound quality is nice but Amazon disappointed me. They were sent this without any precaution .simply sent it.But earphone is good and very comfortable . Amazon please send this type of product with proper packing .

And one more thing I want to add , You missioned that I can pay using card or cash buy delivery boy told me he could not accept card! What is this ? Will you take any action? @amazon"
1029,4.0,"overall the sound and everything is great but I wouldn't recommend it for any sort of hard workouts if that's your main purpose! and these are definitely not for running! I brought these especially for working out and running didn't serve the purpose for me! If you are looking for wireless earphones just for the purpose of running and workout Id strongly recommend not to buy any neckband sort wireless earphones!
ps: their sound is the amazing and best companion for travelling and also the battery is totally amazing!!"
1030,4.0,"The sound quality is fine, the bass is also okay. They are very light, so if you use them while running or working out you don't even feel them. The battery life is also good. Most importantly if you work out or run then you don't have to constantly worry about the wire being pulled. So for ₹999 these are a good catch."
1031,3.0,"sound quality is good but not as the Boat Wired Earphones provide yet better than Boult BT Earphones (i replace boult with this boat product), bass is good but not clear, worst part is that tiny charging Jack cover. its too tiny and weak that i have lost it in just 4-5 days. battery backup is ok it gave me 5-6 hours backup. another worst part is sometimes you can't take a call because it goes blank on call.. product quality is good.. overall."
1032,3.0,"Writing the review after using it for six months.
The earphones was good till 4 months but the battery life has deteriorated considerably. It goes from 60% to 20% suddenly. Apart from battery life the fit is also not suitable for long usage,it hurts the ears.
Only upside is the BASS. Sound quality is medium,nothing great. Its easy to pair and not bad range.
I would recommend the wired boats rather than this."
1033,1.0,"After 6month of usage one of the side not working, when checked on website this is common problem and worst part customer service is not good they do not pick call. It's better not to buy-people can save their precious time."
1034,2.0,"Sound quality is good but there's lot of disturbance while playing music. Sounds like music is buffering due to slow internet connection even though I am playing tracks which are saved in my phone. When they are saying it's has Qualcomm technology for better connectivity then I don't expect this.
Another issue is battery drains too fast. If I charge fully in the morning then I need to charge in the afternoon coz it's switched off.

I have given the 2 stars for the sound quality only otherwise it's not much worth."
1035,4.0,"This is the top notch wireless Bluetooth earphone that I have used under 1K the sound quality is astonishing and not like anything I have used before, since I have used so many high end headphones I was surprised to see the sound reproduction and the amount of Bass I was getting from speakers.
""definitely recommend & definitely go for it if you want something like BIG-Bang for your bucks"""
1036,1.0,"Very bad product. Service is very poor. My device was not charging and great difficulty one support CENTER got it in Basavangudi.
But so pathetic if you have everything they will find something to proof for not giving warranty . Final I had to pay Rs550/- for only not having charger rubber cover on it.lot of customers was unhappy on that day in that CENTER because rude behaviour and not supporting customer. Please do not buy boAT Product and save your money ."
1037,2.0,"All the discounted headphones are referbished. I bought two and both after few months started having issues in one or both ear piece. When opened, the inside of both are having different types of packing and wire length had already given that hint."
1038,5.0,"Sound quality is good. It is loud enough to be used while traveling or running.
Once you lose the rubber bushes which keeps the earbuds in place, they'lll keep falling down from your ears even while walking."
1039,4.0,"Its a good quality one. But don’t expect much noise cancelling feature (I would say nothing for noise cancelling) sound quality is good and the major advantage is its good for rough use. It will not get damaged easily. I am using this from last 3 months.
After using this I bought one rocker 275. That have better sound quality but too delicate. This model is good for bike riders and rough using. This will not get much moisture wicking but the ear cushion is not much good for longer user. I am about change that now"
1040,2.0,"Over all it is a below average product.

-Very uncomfortable in my ear, painful after 15-20mins only.
-Sound quality is very low and not clear many a time.
- Bass is ZERO.
-As you can see in the picture, it is on charging so frequently.
- and the WORST part is; you are not allowed to return it even you want to replace it Amazon will replace it with the same product, why the hell I'll order the same product again with so many flaws.

Amazon atleast allow me to pick other product."
1041,3.0,"Based upon reviews purchased this headset during the sale for 1K. The question is ""Did it live up to my expectations? I would rather say no. Previously I've been using Samsung very old first model headset, where sound quality would be clear but would have a low base. That's the reason why it lasted long. But this one (boat) has a pretty good noise cancellation, decent bass but not like mentioned by majority of reviews. And 1 major issue is while driving, connection goes off turns on at times which is quite irritating."
1042,3.0,"Too much bass and therefore less treble on default settings.
However the same could be adjusted from (external) phones/ laptops equalizer.

Looks good and sporty. The red colour of the wire connecting the buds is soothing and looks good to the eye but the red colour on the actual buds is kind of metallic red which is okish.

Takes too long to charge from zero to full, couple hours actually. The battery lasts 5-6 hours which which is okay."
1043,5.0,"I'm not satisfied with this product.. when compared to wired headset it is not good.. Already I replaced this item once. This is the second item, here also I'm getting noise during call and disconnection while watching movies and not getting any alert during low battery. My friend using this same product, I have used his headset but didn't find any problems and also getting beep sounds while battery is going down.. Request you to replace with good product ASAP.."
1044,5.0,"Excellent product. Sound quality is pretty good, and paired with my phone pretty quickly. Just now trying to connect with second device. Couldn't connect it yesterday.
Amazon delivered the package on time, and packing was also decent.
So overall, product is very good, light weight too. So you hardly feel the weight of it on the neck
Will post after use review in some days."
1045,2.0,"Please get me refund or replacement of my order
Just open to check my ordered piece, but it is not getting charge neither getting connected to my device
Although charged for about 30min but still problem not resolved
On top of all odds, charging wire also already having issue. Not getting plugged At all.
Very much disappointed, However the look and feel is really great and very satisfying.
I have placed request for returning the item"
1046,1.0,Got spoilt in a week. Stopped charging. Got a prompt replacement but that also stopped working. Finally I gave up on BOAT vowing never to purchase bluetooth sports headsets. Personally for me bluetooth sports headsets have never worked. I have tried Sony etc but it is never long lasting.
1047,3.0,I bought this product . In 3 months time one side of the ear piece is not working..they told there is a warranty for that either it will be repaired or it will be changed... I have raised a request one week back till now no one came to take the product from me.. when I called customer care of Boss services they kept my call in hold and after 15 min they told that they get back to me ...till now no one called ... I think all these warranty story are just for sake...they are not really cared for solving the issue ..
1048,1.0,"I have got incomplete box , there is only usb cable and earbuds"
1049,1.0,"Having pain when in use for more than 1 hour....
No doubt it has a great bass and to a great extent noise cancellation and decent sound clarity and mindblowing battery but the following dissapointed me though i tried a lot to adjust.
1.Bluetooth range not more than 10m
2. Pain in ear due the conical buds(can be removed)
3. Wires are a bit long which makes it odd in front.
4. No pouch provided.
5. Worst part is very low quality and distoring mic. Other person keeps complaining about my voice."
1050,3.0,"Today 13th Oct 2019
I purchased on Dasara sale on Amazon for RS.899 ,got delivered on 3rd Oct 19'.

Pros:
Best Bluetooth headset in this price range.
Base Sound quality is good.
Flexible around neck.

Cons:
Battery drains in a couple of days if it's in no use.
Battery backup is low (4-5 hours). Disappointing.
Bluetooth gets disconnected when battery is below 20%."
1051,3.0,"Noice cancellation is too bad. Excet the caller voice you can here ever single voice.
The bass is too high. You can not play music for long time/high volume if you are music lover then choose another one.
Well rest of things is fine if you use this product for just talk and if you use it into the car or noice free place."
1052,5.0,"I would just say best Bluetooth headphones in this budget. I got it for around 1300 but you can get this around 999 in sales. Sound quality is good, battery life is decent, comfort is not that good because of bulkier earpieces, mainly if you loves to watch or listen while going to sleep it gets uncomfortable. If you can bare with this drawback then these are good pair of headphones. Just go for it."
1053,4.0,"This was my first Bluetooth earphones and mark my words my experience with these were awsome .the built design is so comfortable which give you a very good feel, and talking about the battery backup it's so amazing as compared to other brands ,the design of earbuds are soo good which fits perfectly in ears and u can be assured of its fitting it will not fall even if you went running with it, and the Bluetooth gets connet to mobile or any other device very easily."
1054,4.0,"Sound quality: a bit disturbance in sound when you go beyond 5 metres from your Bluetooth source.
Bass: no words. It's boombastic
Noise cancellation : it's actually more than enough I wonder if somebody bang into a tree while running. It's that level of noise isolation
I thing price must be 1200 because 1500 is a bit expensive in this range because better earphones are available in this price range +- 200 .
Buy it it's worth ,atleast worth than 4000 cost earphones .
Jai hind vandematram"
1055,5.0,"Great service by Amazon. Fast delivery as always.
Build quality is awesome.
Bass is GOOD.
It is not that loud with full volume.
Overall great product. Go for it guys.
Using this one with iPhone & Samsung, works great."
1056,1.0,I did not get the product . Only empty box .
1057,5.0,"For the price this is the best.

Excellent quality and battery life. On a single charge I can go anywhere between 6-8 Hours based on the usage.

CON: I wish there was a proper carrying case for this."
1058,1.0,"Sound quality when listening to songs : Good when listening to songs. Covers good distance.
Sound quality on phone calls : Completely dissatisfied. Does not cover even one meter. Sound breaks when on call
Noise cancellation : Not great. Ok Ok

Overall not satisfied."
1059,3.0,"First I'll talk about pros
Sound quality is decent for the price if you can get it in 1000rs on sale otherwise better options are available.
Noice cancellation is pretty good
Battery life is pretty decent as well
Cons
I find Bluetooth connectivity poor I don't know if it is the problem with my device
Cause when I walk wearing this and having phone in my pocket there are lot of glitches in connection which I found pretty annoying"
1060,4.0,Considering the price point and the brand the product is superbly amazing. I bought it at Rs 1200 and till now I am not facing any problem except the microphone that is not that good and sometimes when I travel in a two wheeler there is a Bluetooth lag ( rarely ) . The noise cancellation pretty good but you can't wear this earphone for too long as I had faced headache after 1-2 hrs of use (depends on the individual)
1061,3.0,"Overall Good!
One earplug stopped working after 5 months.
Voice sometimes not clearly audible to the person on other side on phone call!"
1062,1.0,"All are good only it will work for 3 mnths from the date of purchase after 3rd month one side will not work..

Please if any one is Interest o buy this don't waste your money my humble request they will give less price but it worth of only 2 months

Customer care also worst all are giving very fake hope on the replacement..

Pls don't buy this product"
1063,5.0,"First of all thank you for selling good products.

I ordered this product for gift purpose, but received in damage condition (charging section cover was damaged, charging kit not avaliable within box).

Same we replace this, next day i received this replacement with good condition,
sound quality Amazing......🆒
look wise 💯% cool.
battery back also good🔋4.5 to 5 hours

Value of money....🙏"
1064,3.0,"Writing this review after one month usage.
Product is meant for people who prefer good bass. Sound quality starts dropping once u move away from object let it be like 4-5 meters too initial it was better. As it takes into consideration your body deflection ,and sound of a person talking is like he is in water.
battery life is good.sound quality is better as i grabbed it for discount at 1200/₹.
Actually would give 3.5 🌟"
1065,5.0,"It's a good product.
Clear sound when listening to music and movies.
Also it's clear to communicate on calls.
Had bought JBL earlier but returned same day as the recipient couldn't hear me clearly but in this one no complaints it's very clear and audible to them."
1066,5.0,"Sound quality is wonderful and pichi perfect HD quality, I prefer music lovers to buy this because I searched good Bluetooth earphones for 2weeks in Amazon I saw this product reviews and ratings I thought that before buying with average expectations and after using this I loved this product very much.
Noise cancellation is perfect.
While using if we go to long distance it will disconnect automatically and when going near to mobile it automatically connect to the mobile device in fraction of seconds."
1067,1.0,"I had order one of these earphones that stopped functioning within 5 months. I asked for a replacement since it was within warranty period. They delivered similar product that wasn't working either. Tried calling customer care but they are not taking call since then. Only once did the call connect to a female in customer care cell, the last literally cut the call as I started explaining it to her. Didn't expect such a pathetic service at your end. Would not recommend it to anyone."
1068,5.0,Lives up to the expectation. Good finishing.. Sporty look. Great sound & bass. Choose the music mode from your phone if it's available. Volume & play/pause button work great. Long press volume up/down buttons to change songs. Middle button picks/hangs up calls... Great deal..!!
1069,1.0,"My suggestion if company give you a product at free of cost kindly perfer any other company product as these product required servicing on every two month.
On 21st sep i was again register complaint it's Stop working and these is my thrid time where register complaint.

I feel company should learn from any other brand how Bluetooth earphone made and work for longtime.

In this duration I hardly used for two month remaining six month i was registered complaint and getting replacement."
1070,5.0,I was looking for Bluetooth headphones and I came across with this. This headphones are useful if you're looking for basic and daily basis. I travel daily in heavy crowd of train so much useful as I can keep my phone in bag and can attend calls or listen my playlist without any disturbances. Battery life is good and sustained for 2 days once fully charged.
1071,3.0,"First i have got a defected piece which was working fine for a week and then left earphone stopped working, then aftet raising this to the boAt, they have replaced it with new one. Overall the product is nice as per the price. Noise cancellation is good and the sound also. If you are planning to spend 1K on a headphones this is good option."
1072,3.0,"Sound quality of the product is very good , Paring takes 30 seconds, amazingly easy . The biggest problem is in the zest to increase the bass , manufacturer has increased the overall diameter of the speaker , this when covered with rubber gloves is tight to ears and start to hurt after 20 , 30 minutes of usage . I felt the design to fit in on all types of ears is not universal , could have been of better design , i could not use them after 20 min due to an uneasy feeling and pain"
1073,5.0,"Bought it at 899.
Sound quality is good.
More focus is on Bass. You will feel bass.
It is best at this cheap prize.
Bluetooth connection is good. Wire is long so that allow to use while any activity.
For those who wants good product at its best prize can buy."
1074,5.0,"Sound quality is okayish but best for price range.
Noise cancellation is good.
Causes pain in ear after long use of more than 3-4 hours. So not that comfortable.
Good for listening music while workout, fits tightly in the ear.
Bass is good but treble, mids and low's of the music are muffled.
Battery life proves to be of 4-6 hours.. and 2-3 hours during call."
1075,1.0,"Product stopped working within 4 months and I returned it for repair/replacement, It’s almost a that they collected the product for repair and I’m still waiting for them for any update about the product, it took almost 15 days to reach their service center and now it’s almost 15 days and it is still in their service center.... very poor service from boat.... the product didn’t even serve for 4months and the replacement or repair of the product is taking too long... Even no boat customer desk numbers work...."
1076,2.0,"It may be tempted by seeing this product, because of price and everyone around you is buying this product. I also bought the same due to the same reason. Frankly speaking, this is a good product (just like any BOAT), but the problem is it won't even last a year. I bought this on 27th August 2019, but just afer 3 months and 10 days, one of my ear buds lost audio; and it's now useless. About it's bluetooth connectivity, you can get good quality about 3-4m only not more than that."
1077,5.0,"Bass was almost good, atleast way better then wireless earphones of same range. Design is good magnet provided realy makes it feel great. Sound quality is good, clear sound, mic works perfect, no problem faced, amazed that it could actually connect with my phone and lappy together and swithched to phone auto when there was a call, battery life is pretty awesome, got almost 8-9 with first use, problem was that nither my oneplus 6t nor my lappy could show the ryt battery level. Got at 1400 so a pretty awesome deal."
1078,3.0,"I ordered this product on lightening deal. I got at 999. Product is good but used low quality plastic used in neckband after used 2 days left side wire loose from neckband attachment. Left this afterall product is good.
*Sound clear, Bass also deep.
*Bluetooth connectivity range disturb after
2 meter distance.
*Battery is good. After 10 mins charging u can use for 1 hrs."
1079,3.0,"Build and sound quality is Good not very good,
you cannot talk with this headphone as it has very sensitive mic or no noise cancellation for mic !
so you can hear lots of noise when pickup your phone calls
i have to disconnect my bluetooth from my mobile and than pickup my calls manually.

So please go for some good brands like Sony,.."
1080,1.0,"Do NOT go for this. Bought it thinking about the company and it's supposedly nice features. First 4 months, Everything was fine. Noice cancellation was good. But the 5th month, without any warning the right side stopped working. Morning it was fine. Evening spoilt. It was exactly in the Same place where I had kept it. No wire cut. Nothing. Just like that. Paying so much we expect it to be durable for atleast an year. But 4 months??! It's absurd. I do not recommend this to anyone. Waste of money. Nonsense"
1081,2.0,Sound quality is not up to the mark as claimed by boat. I have mi earphones but they have much better sound in the same range. Also battery backup is vry poor. It can only run upto 3 hours after full charging while watching movie. This is not acceptable.
1082,4.0,"Good battery life, excellent sound quality at affordable price is the hallmark of BOAT. Only issue i face is the headset battery indicator is not accurate and u will have to form your own judgement as to when the headphone needs to be recharged. Overall good purchase, i have already recommended same to 4 other people who now are also happy with BOAT."
1083,5.0,"Overall the product is perfectly fine from bass, terrible, noise cancellation, battery everything is up to mark. Boat is providing the best ever music quality and it's for sure a product that can be purchased with close eyes.

Cons
**Amazon packing is worst, I have got the product with open sealed, I was thinking about the return but though product was running alright I changed my mind to keep it so.

**No casing, sometimes it became hard to keep them apart from wearing."
1084,5.0,"1sf of all, I have to thank to Amazon..for the delivery. The product delivered the next day of order.. Coming to the Product...I'm writing this review after using 1 week.. excellent product for it's price point... Sound quality is awesome..Best Bluetooth under 1500 rs...But the only problem is that.. battery Lasts 6 hrs continuous music play... which is enough.."
1085,5.0,"I bought it just like that without much idea or research about the product. However, it was a surprisingly amazing performance by it that all my family members asked me to get it for them. This is my third boat rockerz and I feel this is second to none in its price category. Kudos to the production line and design."
1086,5.0,"However i haven't used them properly. But one of my friend is using them. Perfect noise cancellation, great bass. Can be used for outdoors, while riding on bike. Mic is very sensitive. I think earbuds are having mic on each of them. Magnetic lock. Couldn't wait for the sale to buy it for 999. I bought it for 1499."
1087,5.0,"Great company and good product. Bluetooth connectivity is good and very responsive. I am using it with two devices simultaneously, Laptop and mobile. Build quality is also good and have a good battery backup."
1088,4.0,"Nice headphones but not totally noise cancellation.base is gud.battery stands
arround 8-9 hr.overall it is gud deal @999 ,bcz a gud color earphone is arround @2500-@3000 like sony, Skullcandy,and JBL brands...battery is equally works so I think it is great deal in this price section"
1089,5.0,Awesome product within 2000 range ...bass is excellent...noise cancellation is nice..dolby sound experienced...if u have vr box and this earphone then u will feel like heaven u can listen each n every beat clearly with powerfull bass beats and sound clearity...i will give 10 out of 5 stars..because product is excellent...!!go for it...!!!thanks a lot to amazon services...😍👍
1090,5.0,I was exchanged this product becacuse i got duplicate product with missing items and i got this product was original boat product with all items and packing was great sound cancellation was pretty good bluetooth connectivity was up to 10m and the product is awesome
1091,5.0,"After a month of using I'm reviewing this, Yeah it's really a good product. Battery life is also good, Good for listening songs while walking.Satisfied i feel. but if u need to headsets for
singing karaoke, I will not prefer this, otherwise it is awesome..."
1092,4.0,"A good Bluetooth headset from Boat, which could have been made better. Noise cancelation,connectivity is good, but sound is not that good, low frequency base is good, but other music has lesser clarity( mostly due to Bluetooth connectivity). If you have a wired headphones, please think once before buying, if you want a wireless one, then please go ahead and buy it"
1093,1.0," Unable to switch on the device even after charged for 3 hours. Not able to use. When the charging is on the blue light is blinking, tried multiple times to charge it and use but in vain. Bought it on 1 st August 19but within 3 months the device is not working. Thinking that I made a wrong decision by Busying bOAT device , unfortunately advised some of my colleagues who bought it last week. Waste of money."
1094,4.0,"Sound quality s gud. I bought tis mainly to talk and it meet my expectations. Super bass and loved to hear songs in it.
Bluetooth connectivity s super its easy to connect with voice notification and also with gud signal i can talk in hall with my mob in room.
Noise cancellation s not available in it.
Only drawback i felt as it is small earbud it doesnt fit my ears well i have adjust it often as it falls other than tat i like tis boat rockerzz earphone much."
1095,4.0,"Based on usage so far I have very few complaints. The buttons that are programmed for volume, can't be programmed for media changer. And that there is no caller id in the earphones, but apart from these I love the product. Yes the sound quality or noise cancellation is not as great as airpods or high end earphones, which is obvious given the cost of the product. But for the price, the product is great."
1096,5.0," My first priority for buying this product is comfort level 5/5 I have slept so many times wearing this earphones
This earphones have best fitting 5/5
It's Noice cancellation is very impressive 4.5/5 I am a hosteler so when I go to mess or noisy area I usually use this earphones
Sound quality is good not best at this price 4/5
Bass is good for me not for others because it doesn't have heavy loud bass
Quality is very good
Range is okk , upto 10m distance"
1097,1.0,"The wire torm out in 3 months. 1 ear bud was working even that also stopped now.
False off from hear and neck. wire is too long. buds are not mold firmly to wire. Dont buy any boat product. Cheap quality"
1098,1.0,"Guys no doubt product is good but one side of earphone is not working. I buy 2 boat earphone yet but both of them one side is not working after 4-5 month. I am paying around 1k for this product totally disappointment by boat. Better go for other products. Similar things happen with my friends also. Dnt go with review, product is good but if u spend 1k then atlist it can work 1year. Boat product life time is 6month. Very disappointment buy products."
1099,1.0,You have delivered the fake product to me and i need replacement of same and i got to know this from your service center as they have given me the proof of fake and original product. I visited at karolbagh service center(Aswani communication) and they clearly told me that it is fake product and we can't replace it. Purchased it on 27 Nov 2019 and now its not working and there is no physical damage on same as well. Photos of fake vs original attached and they also given by authorised service center.
1100,1.0,"Hi friends, I'm writing this review after 4 months of using this product, intially it has good sound and bass was awesome but this head phones life was not good with in 4 months my right side of the speaker stopped working and left side of the speaker works with less sound and the quality of the product is very cheap. I would like to suggest you not to purchase this product."
1101,4.0,"Worth for price. Good wireless headphone for mobile usage .
Not sure about music.
Microphone should have been on the left side of neck holder so that people on riding two wheeler can adjust it with left hand in india. Microphone can part can extended little bit so that it can be positioned under the chin to send a clear audio to other end."
1102,5.0,"Hello i am ramesh. i am using these bluetooth for 2 months.
pros
1.sound quality superb.
2.bass is excellent.
3.Best budget earphones
4. charging is good. For full charge it will take 1.5 hours . It lasts for one 7 hours if we use continuously
cons
wires are large given it would be nice if wires are small. It is not good for running as well since there is shaking in wires, it feels little bit discomfort while running or jogging. It is the only con i have noticed."
1103,3.0,I bought the earphones around 15 days ago so it's too early to say about longevity but what I have observed is that the sound quality is not good. Its too loud and hurts the ear and you don't get to notice the low notes of music clearly. One of my friends has Mi Bluetooth earphones and they have much greater clarity.
1104,3.0,"Boat I believe in your potential please improve.
The bass seems to come suddenly compressing the mids and highs, basically overpowering the actual song. So not enjoyable headphones despite I used equilizer to reduce bass."
1105,3.0,"Earphone sound quality - 2.5/5 (Much worse than a cheap wired earphone)
Microphone quality - 1/5 (Sound keeps breaking and no noise cancellation)
Coolness factor - 5/5 (Nice looking and wireless)"
1106,4.0,Mine is green color but color is not darkest as in the photo abd about sound it is ok who listens slow music or melidy songs but for full bass listeners go for costly 1 as jbl or more than 2k rs and battery stanby is good grip is very good snd also no disturbance to side people if u put on max vol. ok thank u if my review helpful plz like mro on box 2999.00 i got o lighting deal for 999.00
1107,5.0,"Just got the product..
Amazon didn't say anything about carry pouch..
in the box it's written pouch inside but no pouch inside..
Build quality is superb as expected from boAt..
Connectivity is simple.. bluetooth range is nice..
it has a nice neck band..
Now coming to the performance..

If u r a music lover go for it..
everything is great.
bass is excellent..
music is awesome..

coming to call quality again it's awesome..
didn't check battery life yet.."
1108,1.0,The product looked fine when I opened it. But it didn't sound well. Sound was leaking multiple times. I used it while jogging and I couldn't hear a single song perfectly. Disappointed.
1109,1.0,Worst product i have ever bought guess what started giving issues right after the replacement duration is over and ofently best reviews were withing 2-3 days this review is after 15 days of usage. This buletooth earphones gets disconnected automatically after every 2 mins (with one plus 6t & Honor holly 3) i would recommend not to buy this product there's various different Bluetooth earphones which you can look for at this price range based on my personal experience i do not suggest it to any one.
1110,5.0,More than what I expected. I always brought high end earphones and lately understood that high-end earphones are not worth the price.Hence I went for this budget one (1100 rs).Its really awesome .It’s quality is equal to the high end earphones I had.Never expected such a excellent sound output.There is a good balance between Bass and Treble.Lightweight and raging red colour addsup to the euphoria it creates. Unmatchable sound quality for this price and comfortable wear.
1111,5.0,"It has truly surpassed my expectation. The design and build quality is amazing. Bluetooth range is amazing. it can be simultaneously connected with two devices and it connects really fast. Battery lasts almost 6-7 hrs with medium volume. Sound quality is great for the price range I would say. You must not expect the quality of same priced wired earphone but that being said, this one is not too far behind. I absolutely loved this earphone. I got it for ₹999 which makes it a must buy at this price."
1112,4.0,The earphones are good enough for people not looking for something extremely great. Good dound quality and great connectivity. Backup is around 6 hours like mentioned in description. The only thing i found bad which others users have also mentioned is call quality. There is literally zero noise cancellation on call. Other person keeps on complaining that they can hear all the noise around except my voice. Overall.. its a good choice in this budget. Convinient to handle.
1113,5.0,Sound quality is very good more than expected from a 1499 earbuds. After a long time enjoyed music. Bass is ultimate. Call quality is very good indoors. Didn't test it outdoors yet. I watched lots of best bluetooth devices video reviews and this one is listed in top 3. Hence considered buying it and it has turned out to be a good decision. Happy with it. Will test it more and update. Hope it will give a good battery life. 110 mah should last long
1114,1.0,"Worst Bluetooth earphones ever. Go for BOULT anytime. Bluetooth connectivity fails even when you go 5 feet away from your cell. I remember using my Boult earphones from bedroom till hall without any problem. Sound breaks even when ur cell is in ur jeans back pocket. Worst battery backup..Boult kills boat here as well. I bet you will get a feeling or using wire earphones..bcz dts d max range it can perform average.
Do not buy and then regret."
1115,1.0,"I bought this product so that it is mainly for good base and sound quality but it is not satisfied when I am going for ......

I was using boult loop in ear deep bass comparison below.
1. Bolt has better bass effect and sound precision which boat does not..
2. Bass quality is low and zero only treble is high and loud sound.
3. Nothing for ₹1000 when it has been compared to others in this prize range."
1116,1.0,"I bought boat 255 rockerz in December 2018 and it's got non functional in 6 months flat, then I got it replaced and the replacement also got non functional again in 6 months period. So my experience with this earphone says this is product is good for 6 month only. Buy with care."
1117,2.0,"I have just ordered this headphone. Sound from the music apps and videos are good but on call it has a constant buzzing sound and CVC is ZERO. I thought to replace it but for some reason I couldn't. But still I felt to review it because I'm completely frustrated right now hearing all kind of complaints from those people whom I talk too through this earphone. It is not worth the price.
Please let me know if this issue comes under manufacturing defect and I still can exchange/return it."
1118,5.0,Good to opt for if you want a low range bluetooth earphones with long lasting battery life. Sound Quality is good though not as good as other models of Boats earphones. There's little bass. Bluetooth connectivity is impressive. And battery lasts for almost a day of normal usage and 5-6 hours of heavy usage. Only drawback is its very poor noise cancellation. You can't use it to talk on calls. Person on other side will hear all other surrounding sounds except your voice.
1119,4.0,"Nice earphone with super bass, good build quality with rich music experience. Thanks Amazon for quick delivery and amazing product. Will definitely recommend it."
1120,3.0,"The sound lag is much less and noise cancellation is great. I never had any issues with Bluetooth connectivity as I keep my phone in my hand or pocket when using it.
It doesn't hurt your ears if you wear it properly. The only problem I can see is the battery back up system. It has low battery capacity and after giving you the warning of low battery it hardly gives you 10 mins. So that's the only problem I face. So for me it's a good choice."
1121,3.0,"It's noise cancellation isn't very effective. U need to speak loudly for other party to hear your voice. Also, battery goes straight from 100 to 80% and theb to 60% in no time. After this just gives 3-4 warning within 5minutes of play and it'll go off. 60% battery means, it should hold at least for 30-40 mins but it doesn't. Good in terms of bass and sound quality. Overall it's an average product with lots of advertisement and marketing."
1122,5.0,"Product is very good, good sound quality specially bass,battery life is also ok but not very good..but this is not for daily basis use,i used till 2 months but the wire of that earphone got problem,it became onesided earphone...i used it for my workout and travell and it got problem in wire..so its not for daily basis work.life is very less of that earphone...if u are going to purchase that so think more according to ur usage...otherwise product is quality is very good but not have long life.."
1123,5.0,"I like the whole package(build quality, packaging, earbuds ,light weight, super comfy) the battery is good..it's all comes to the sound quality....for a Rs1200-1500 earphone it's too low....it's all bass...nothing but bass...nobody wants that much bass..used loads of other earphones..sound is too bassy...otherwise descent product"
1124,4.0,"Working well
Product quality is good and sound and bass is also very well
Bit of latency problem while playing game I experienced minor sound lag overall great during music and videos
Not really impressed with battery life, average battery life."
1125,3.0,"I was hoping for great BASS which is not easily found in most low to medium budget headphones, but disappointed with it :-( Sound clarity is excellent, but output is so sharp & piercing that it could damage your hearing if you do NOT remember to reduce the volume by at least 2 points before plugging in! Over all, it is okay for the price but I already have an over-the-ear Bluetooth headset from boAt that I love and hence expected similar sound quality."
1126,5.0,"writing after using it for more than 4 months.

At first lil disappointed due toh connectivity issue, many times it gets disturbance I believe could be bcos of frequency overlapping. But I want to talk about today's experience I am traveling for around 8 hrs now its incredibly working awsm, no battery issues, no connectivity issues, still 60% battery remains. I think its bcos of short distance range.
Earlier I used to take it everywhere hung up on my neck and it everytimes it took time to reconnect. So all in all happy with it now."
1127,4.0,"The product built quality is okays, not as good as Realme Bluetooth earbuds, & sound quality is also average. It has good bass effect but the vocals are submerged due to bass. It doesn't have Cristal clear sound like Sennheiser cx 180 or cx 213. I am returning the product as I am not enjoying listening music on it. Amazon service is great product got delivered within 2 days."
1128,3.0,"1st of all.. Good delivery after 4 days by amazon.
Sound quality is superb. 👌🏻
Bassline is mind blowing without distortion.
Highs are mid average..
Mids are ok.
VOLUME level is low.. I have to tweak to almost 95% for clarity..
WHY there is a SOUND DELAY when playing Games and VIDEOS ?
As a Pro DJ good BT earphones in this price compared to jbl .
Con's: no pouch provided . cable is quite tangling.
MUST BUY for BASS lovers."
1129,1.0,"The sound quality is acceptable from such a cheap pair but there is no proper noise cancellation. But the worst part is that the left earpiece has completely stopped working within 3 months!!
Theres 1 year warranty but no one responded to my request.
Dont waste money on it."
1130,5.0,"It is one of the best Bluetooth based wireless earphones currently available in the market. The battery backup usually lasts up to 8 hours of continuous music listening. Since it is in-ear design, hence noise cancellation is good, however, it lacks active noise cancellation, which I am sure is not present in any product of a similar cost.
Overall, it is a must buy and good to have."
1131,4.0,"I am totally satisfied with the sound quality, durability, noise cancellation mic and finally battery was awesome but as a bike rider I am not going to suggest this one as it doesn't fitting to our neck when we ride two wheeler.
When we r driving the band behind the neck is going back for air which is totally uncomfortable for user and pilon on the bike.
For my Samsung galaxy MAX through this bluetooth headphones i can't use Google assistant as I not supporting for my device, I am not sure this problem is for everyone or not"
1132,4.0,"The best part about this headphone is its sound quality, immersive and deep, way better than some of the more famous brands in this price range.
However, there are no other major features in the headphone, and it is a bit clunky (not user friendly) to use and the blue tooth connection is a bit iffy.
But if you just want to pay for the sound quality and not the frills, then this is an exceptionally good headphone"
1133,5.0,"Make sure your device volume is below 10%,before you connect to this sh* ,if not it blown up your👂.bass,bass,bass,bass,bass. Go for it. Good noise isolation. Before I'm using boat rockerz400. Little bit lake of treble compare to boat rockerz400. But bass is same."
1134,5.0,"My phone had speaker problem so when I try repairing it, the cost was around Rs.2000/- with no gurantee but buying this product at Rs.1500/- fulfilled my requirement and moreover comes with 1 year gurantee."
1135,3.0,"Except for the microphone which is really bad, it's a good buy if you are primarily buying it fit listening to music or watching videos on your phone.

If your usage is for attending regular calls and telephonic meetings, don't go for it!"
1136,3.0,"Hi all,
Im a regular customer of Amazon and like to do shopping in Amazon all the time but this time I was little dissapointed with this product "" Boat Rickerz""
Pros:Good price
Best build quality
Extreme Noise Cancellation
Good connectivity
Cons:
Major con and very crusial one... Other side caller receiving all the sounds clearly except my voice. Its irritating me lot.
If calling is not a major problem for you ,must buy item."
1137,4.0,"Nice product. The neckband which I received first worked one day and then it stopped working. I requested for replacement and their response is too good. Got the replaced piece the next day of the replacement request. Good service. Must try this one. If u have a budget of 2K + then go for boat rockers 275. At this range BOAT ROCKERS 255 IS THE BEST.
Thank u BOAT for such a great product👍✌. 🔥💕💯"
1138,4.0,"Bluetooth connection stability this device connects instantly but while jogging working out or on the move sometimes there is audio delay interruption which is unpredictable sometimes. If I'm using it with the phone in front of me it's awesome but if you want to enjoy music on the move or jogging etc this device will dissappoint you.
The battery% fluctuated.. It means at the time connection battery level was 50/60% after using it for 15/20 min in medium volume the battery gets down ivr response battery low and indicator goes totally red."
1139,1.0,"Poor customer service, bad quality of product, product will stop fucntioning after few months and when you will send this for replacement their customer service and support team will never send a replacement. You will see your case closed and they will keep the product with them... It's a total waste of money and time.. better go for any other brand who are providing better customer support and better quality of product."
1140,2.0,"With in fewdays of use, disconnecting automatically. And not working properly...waste of money...if we submit issue to the boat they're simply sending service center number...worst experience will never purchase boat"
1141,5.0,"It's really a good earphone. Amazon provided a great delivery, I got my product just on the next day of ordering it. I bought it for 1099 during the sales and I must say it is the best wireless earphone I have used. The functions, Battery life, audio quality everything is just awesome.
Ione drawback is that, boat is supposed to provide a carrying case with it. It's really risky to put it in the bag or somewhere else. Otherwise it's the best product."
1142,5.0,"Go for the headphones blindly if you are getting it below 1500. Such a awesome sound quality. Had been using it for almost 6 months and they are awesome I tell you. Best part it is not like most of the bass earphones who sound is not bearable. Just a con, when connected to two devices, say you are listening to music from computer and suddenly receive a call from phone then the voice is bit shaky. Also the range is too good for a earphone like this. Best one from Boats!!!!"
1143,3.0,"If only this the Bluetooth range was little better this would have been an excellent product.

I use thus headphone while running. When I kept my phone on zipped pocket on the back of my track I would often loose connectivity. I had to keep my phone either on my hand or front pocket which was quite inconvenient. I returned the first one but still same problem withbthe second one.

I also wish they’d provide a case for safekeeping."
1144,1.0,"Worthless product distorted sound, nice basss, fatela avaj, battery life was good at starting but after some days you need to recharge battery regular, when battery percentage was 60% or below it's behave like 0% and you need to recharge it, also sounds not good the coming from that little hole is like totally distorted."
1145,4.0,"Battery problem within few months. The earphones got heated whenever i plug them for charging & after few days faced quick battery drain issue as well.

Am giving 4 stars because of their replacement policy. They provide 1 year warranty period. So I raised a complaint in Boat website with the purchase invoice. They picked up my product, reviewed and replaced with a new one within 10 days. If it is a genuine fault, they are providing us with a new one, if it comes under warranty period"
1146,3.0,"Within the range of 1k,this one is good..! But on comparing it with mivi thunderbeat,I would go for mivi.
Cons :
you can't carry it in your pocket
It feels something is hanging to your neck
Not satisfied with the base
Bluetooth range is somehow okay

Pros:
Noise canceling is good
Sound is ok
Battery lasting: fabulous

Conclusion: average product"
1147,1.0,"Please don't buy boat product. you will get repair in below one year damn sure. Even if you try for warranty replacement it will takes at least 2 to 4 months approximately for replacement. customer care guys will never connect your call(if you have any doubt try to connect) and never reply to emails.
Noise cancellation n Bluetooth was not up to the mark.
As per my personal experience I'm suggesting you guys go for a product which have good customer support and quality products."
1148,3.0,"First things first
Headphone is very good...
Connenctivity is awesome...
Connects two devices simultaneously... If u r watching on one device and u receive a call on another then movie will get paused automatically...

The only complaint is call quality... I had received Almost 15 calls on the day when i used it for first time.. and almost all of them asked me to remove my headphones... Bcoz they couldn't listen my voice properly....

So consider this before.. overall ok.."
1149,5.0,"I have tried few other wireless earphones but beats coming from this one is great. It gives a good balanced sound and it is so comfortable that it can be used for long duration. Battery life is also good, battery is easily giving 5 6 hrs of backup. I only found one thing that can be better that it takes a while to charge the battery completely, 1.5/2 hrs for charging.
I have Boats wireless speaker also and that piece is also nice.
Go for it."
1150,4.0,Sound bass is very good feeling like home theater. Battery life is so so. Only 80 and 60% is showing battery life always when i use it 1 day next day it is showing 80% and 3rd day showing 60% after that when battery goes 0% not known. After 60% it can off but not alerting that battery is low.
1151,1.0,"This wireless headset stopped working after one month. I used it only in my home, so it was handled properly without any water or other kind of damages. Suddenly one day it stopped working but charging functionality was working perfect. This headset was fully charged still i can't power it on by pressing it's power button. In service centre they told me the internal IC is damaged anyhow so that's why it's not working."
1152,2.0,Bluetooth range is very low when compare with my Samsung Mono headset...I used for iPhone 6 but it’s not compatible with that in distance..it’s work for me within the room only. But other Mivi bluetooth earphones workin well...I feel it’s waste of money for IPhone 6 users...bcoz I used it only on iphone6
1153,1.0,"Worst Mic ever.
I have used many earphones and headphones earlier but this one is the worst when it comes to mic.
You won't be able to listen to the other person on call. Lot of noise it creates and they will be listening more of our surroundings.
Don't go for it.
But if you are stupid enough and only looking for a earphone which will serve your purpose of just listening music then go for it and make fool of yourself."
1154,4.0,"I am using it since last year I must say worth buying it. I have bought it for @ 999. Easy to carry, I personally use it in the gym during the workout and all the time when I travel from home to office."
1155,3.0,"While the product is cost effective, there are issues with the battery life. It says 6 hours but it just lasts for appx. 3 hours. Also it says 60% battery and then in a split second it starts to display battery low to 20%. This has been happening always. Decent sound quality for the price. Go for it only if you are looking for something cheap to use while it lasts."
1156,4.0,"I have been using for a few months now. It has a battery life of 4/5 hrs.
Good Bluetooth connectivity, sound quality.

The instrument is not tough for rough use. But if used carefully looks like it will last.

Good buy"
1157,1.0,Its not working now how can i return back
1158,3.0,"A couple of people I know have the same earphones and have absolutely no problem, but my earphones are not that great. When connected to the bluetooth, it randomly gets disconnected and sometimes it stays connected and the video keeps playing but the audio is not at all playing. Happened multiple times. Really unhappy with the performance of these earphones, I had expected a lot since I heard good reviews but never met the expectation."
1159,3.0,"This product is fine but noise cancellation is very poor on this device.
Sound: Bass is good vocals are not impressive.
Bluetooth connectivity is perfect.

Earbuds are not comfortable at all. I’ve already Lost my two buds. 🙁
It gets remove automatic. Need to pay attention on this everytime, otherwise you can also lost the earbuds like me."
1160,3.0,"It's okay kind of product, bass and sound quality is okay. Product is good but concern . How product price vary every day . One day 899 and other day 999 with same vendor apprio which is Amazon's subsidiary. What kind of joke Amazon is cracking."
1161,4.0,"It's good one..sound is much better den JBL..

But guys u need to work on battery life.. it's showing 6hrs ..

Bt battery don't complete the race of 6hrs"
1162,3.0,"No Noise cancellation makes it difficult to talk on call mic capturing too much of background noise, speaker is good"
1163,4.0,"Like:
Looks
Sound quality
Ease of connect.

Dislike:
No carry box provided
Poor packaging
Wires are lengthy

*Today i got the product but the box was broken and the product seems to be used one."
1164,1.0,"It's not a joke. It's just a scrap product . Don't know whether I received is a duplicate piece. Because I own boat rockers 600, which is a seamless product from boat. But this purchase irritated me alot and finally I returned it."
1165,5.0,Sound quality is awesome however noise cancellation needs some work. Blietooth connectivity is also seamless. Battery life is good. Using since last 15 days now. No fuss about carying your phone around when you are moving 20-25 feed
1166,1.0,Worst BT Earphone in 1.6K range. After 3-4 months it started Bluetooth connectivity issues. During 4th month left side earphone stopped working. It was understandable that sometimes electronics malfunction so i raised service request to boat service desk and they asked to ship back the earphone for repair. Now its been almost 3 weeks with no feedback nothing and no reply on mail. Customer care number is used to fool customers as no one will reply even if you are on HOLD for 30mins.
1167,5.0,"I give 5 star rating because the sound quality is so Cristal clear and the bass is extraordinary. The battery backup is suberb. The neck band is light weight, so you won't feel and the magnetic lock is so useful, so it won't drop from your neck. You have 1 year warranty so no need to worry expect physicall damage.

My personal experience my headset not working one side after 8 month usage. I got replacement under warranty within 15 days. So customer service is also good."
1168,4.0,"Good headphones for base lovers, though the mids and lows could have been better.
After around 10 month had issue with Bluetooth range and one side earphone stoped working. Under warranty got it replace but the replace process was very slow taking about 22 days."
1169,3.0,"Sound quality is good, noise cancellation is also reliable. The mic has issues, the other person on call always complains about my low volume & in most cases more background noise. After 6 months the right ear piece stopped working."
1170,2.0,"At the time I bought it in February this year, I gave it 5 stars because of its sound and style. But now I am changing it to 2 stars. Right Bud of this earphone stopped working suddenly 2 months back now even though I used it very carefully, I thought there would have been some mistake from my side. I got a replacement which took almost a month. Still no bad review from my side. But the Same Right bud stopped working again now even though I am using it carefully. So, decision to change my review."
1171,5.0,I hardly give product review but guys its superb..specially after using d product fr 4months suddenly oneday d bluetooth stoped pairing with any device...wrote a mail to cstomer service nd within 25days got today a new device..and so go fr it ..as many expendive devices doesnt give such nice service ....
1172,2.0,I purchased this like eight months ago. The ear phone is just unbearable now...it starts showing blue light the after 5 minutes of charging indicating that charge is complete but it can be used to play music for only 15 to 20 minutes after charging. Neither can I charge it nor can I use it. I don't know what to do. I am checking for warranty options now don't know how much of help can I expect.
1173,3.0,"Sound quality and noise cancellation is decent. Bluetooth connectivity is quick. Range is also very good.

Updated review... Battery life is very less. Worked only for 2 days in full charge."
1174,4.0,"I just brought it in last week, and to be very frank,it's really Awesome. Beyond my expectations.
Sound quality is like having your own personal home theatre,too clear and loud enough, you can listen every single bit of music.And coming to battery backup, they said it's 6hrs but it's more than that, for me it's working near about one and more."
1175,4.0,"Looks cool, Sound quality is good, battery drains very fast but charges fast as well, the ear lobes not very comfortable for long use, bluetooth connectivity is quite fast, the voice the man that talks while connecting and disconnecting is very irritating, connects easily with phone while on calls as well and very clear too"
1176,1.0,Awful product. Battery sucks big time. Worked only few days. Even charging for couple of hours. Battery stay for 5 min. Pathetic. Sound quality is good.
1177,1.0,"I bought a second pair of these after using the 1st pair for 6 months, before it conked off... Now the second one is also damaged. Works when plugged in so I am guessing there is a battery issue. Very sensitive ... If you keep it plugged in for more than 5 min after full charge, the battery gets damaged... Very disappointed"
1178,5.0,"On 24th sep the product was delivered and on 28th oct the right side earphone stopped working....even my two other friends bought for them.the same issue..

No physical damage happened but it stopped working..i recommend not to buy this peoduct...

This product is a failure
Almost most of them have same issue

On 28th nov visited service center, they replaced the product and gave a new working product...."
1179,4.0,Overall a good bluetooth earphone. Sound is good. A little more treeble sound could have added a star to the product. Still a better choice to go for and enjoy. Expectations were more but not unhappy too.
1180,3.0,Sound quality is average. Bass is below average... horrible experience using this. After 2hrs of usage ears starting paining... Bluetooth range is around 5ft only after that it fluctuate. Noise cancelling is good. Wires are bit longer so it looks ridiculous. and on using this earphone on above medium level of volume it lasts for around 3 hrs only... Overall please don't buy it go for other options with lighter weights of earphones.
1181,1.0,"Got defective piece. Voice during call was cracking. Buzzing noise continuously.
Dont purchase if you want to use for voice call.
I think seller is sending all the rejected pieces by customers."
1182,5.0,"Bass as promised. Water resistant as promised. Noise cancellation not as good as compared to Sony. If you're looking for a Bluetooth headset below 1000 go for it.
Can be used for sports activities as it sticks on the ear with the ear bud design.
Good for sport lovers."
1183,2.0,"Price is best.
Worst battery life.
Four years back, I purchased Nokia wireless earphone, which had option save battery when not working, but Boat don't have that yet in this earphones.
If you are using apple earphones, then you'll not like bass of this Boat earphones."
1184,3.0,"Pros

1. Product is durable during workouts and changing weather conditions
2. Has demonstrated good battery backup

Cons

1. Treble, bass and other tunnings doesn't take any effect on this product

Overall : The money paid would be of value if you're focus is same as the above pros and also should be in a position to compromise the music quality/feel to some extent."
1185,1.0,Do not order it .I have rcvd wrong item which is cheap 100 rs handsfree(Wired). Either vendor shipped it incorrectly or delivery boy stolen it but Great thing is Amazon says that they can not do any thing in this and as per them they shipped correct item and disconnected the call. Now i have left with that cheap earphone instead what i had ordered and paid for.
1186,5.0,"I was under confusion about the brand ""boat"" as most of us are habituated with Sony -senhiser-jbl etc.I gave a tried and very happy about the sound output you can go for it without hesitation.Super bass and treble as like senhiser.Small part need to check from boat company that is charging point of ear phone can be redesigned."
1187,2.0,"Dear Amazon Team,

Please note I had booked a Boat Rockerz Bluetooth earphones from Amazon, it received in intact condition and was working fine, but now it is not working at all.

When you plug in the charger the LED is working and earphones are working & as soon as the charger is removed the earphones stop working

Requesting you to kindly replace these earphones at the earliest

Awb: 221921225468
Regards,"
1188,4.0,"Great deal at 999 actually it's a steal at that price point i only wish they will release the next version with better features
Wishlist
*I wish the earphones will stop playing as soon as the magnet's are connected like one plus and will autoplay as soon as disconnect tgis is the only feature i wish it had
*Type-C usb charging
*Improved battery
*Improved sound quality"
1189,5.0,"First impressions with one day usage.

Pros :--
1. Extra Bass.
2. Battery (got around 8 hours from out of the box without charging even once)
3. Good connection.
4. Comfortable.

Cons :--

1. Build quality.
2. Wires are little bit long.

Go for it if you are looking at Bluetooth Earphones under 1.5k. I got it for 1,299/- rupees."
1190,3.0,the product is good but i am disappointed by the packaging the box of product looks damaged luckily the product is working what if it didn't than i would be denied refund or replacement blaming the damaged on me the movement i looked at the box i was scared hopeing that the product was working properly
1191,4.0,"Product do not last long on a single charge
Max duration after one charge is 100 minutes.
Sometime it gives you 4 hours backup.
In terms of quality, yes it is a nice good quality build product as we can expected from boat.
The charging percentage decreases in multiple of 20 (eg: 100, 80 , 40,) after 40 it start beeping to indicate to plugin the power source.
In this price rage you can't get any better then this product."
1192,2.0,"The product seemed good initially (including the design, weight balance, sound quality etc). However, within 15 days of use, it has started behaving funny as it gets disconnected after 30 minutes of use (even when mobile is in my pocket). So, I can't trust this Bluetooth earphone while taking official calls."
1193,4.0,Nice
1194,2.0,Sound coming off these seem imbalanced. The vocals seem to be in the background and the instruments in the foreground. Also can't run or jog wearing these as the part with the buttons keep hitting your collar bone.
1195,1.0,"Do not buy. Worst product. Stopped working for the second time.
Ordered it on 15th July, product was delivered on 16th.
One side of the earbud stopped working in first week of Oct 2019. Got it replaced from the company. For users information, company allows ine time replacement warranty.
Now since the product I use is already replaced earlier, the product is out of warranty.
Rs.999 I spent on this product is a complete loss to me."
1196,3.0,"The noice cancellation of this earphone is above all the earphones in this range
But for me it was not useful

Well..even after it comes with ear support..it doesn't fit my ear..comes out of the year as i make some movement..
Thus not meant for me.."
1197,4.0,"After using it for 2 weeks i felt like it's time to write a review about the product....
Pros:
sound quality is decent
Battery life is around 5 to 5:30 hours
Bass and noise cancellation are cool...so you can enjoy your music in all modes of traveling as well...
Cons:
So far I have found only one that is wire length is a bit more.
If they can provide adjustable wire length that should be fine."

1199,4.0,"Its Almost 2 months since i am using this headset. Since last one week i am experiencig a small glich sort of problem with this one. Like if i am watching a video or movie it cancels itself and voice gets in normaly so i will have to reconnect it again. I am right now checking on the occurence again.

Overall the product is good. Flexible and comfy to carry around. Charge stays through out the day."
1200,1.0,"I have bought this recently and And after a month of use, the charging pin in the earphones got broke, and I am be able to charge it anymore. A fault with the manufacturing.
Bluetooth connectivity is super fast, you don't get to choose, some times glitchy.
Sound quality is good but can be better.
Noise Cancellation - okok
But about the Charging, it lasts not so long.
Not recommended."
1201,2.0,"PROS-
I GOT FOR JUDT 1K ON SALE
BASS IS GOOD
FOR PRICE OVERALL SOUND QUALITY IS DECENT
CON-
AT FRIST BATTERY LIFE IS GOOD AFTER USING FOR FEW WEEKS BATTERY LIFE STARTED DRAINING
IT AS SEVERAL CONNECTIVITY ISSUES SOMETIMES IT DISCONNECTS AUTOMATICALLY
AT MAX VOLUME SOUND WILL START DISTRACTING
COMES WITH LONG WIRES WHICH LOOKS WEIRD
DONT BUY THESE WIRELESS EARPHONE MORE THAN 1K"
1202,4.0,"The overall performance is worth the money... But what i wanted more was the buttons for the next song or to go back to the previous song...

Noise cancellation is good and every other mode of performance is good... Battery backup is great.....
Perfect product in all ways for the money spent...."
1203,1.0,Very poor quality.. good for listening music only. To make calls it's utter waste... The mike captures all noise around even 5-8 meters away.. so the other person on call can't hear anything clearly... Very much disappointed..
1204,1.0,"Just keeping my phone in my pocket resulted in lose of Bluetooth connectivity.
Maybe only my earphones had that defect.. others may not have to face it. Buy the product, us it for 2-3 days. If good keep it or else there's a return option in Amazon.
I've returned it though."
1205,2.0,This is my replacement order and facing same issue. Other person can't here my voice properly during the call via Bluetooth. They can only here background disturbance even i sit in room. Eco problem! Deciding to return and order some other brand. This is only good for music.
1206,2.0,Sound quality is not crystal clear...On high volume it's very bad...The microphone is very bad actually that doesn't have noise cancellation...when ever I take a call when there is little disturbance...They other person is not able to listen my voice but he's able to listen all the disturbances.I literally hate this.even I replaced but the same problem that means this product is not well built
1207,5.0,"This is my 2nd purchase and it works as advertise. For the price this is best what one can get. Good bass, don't ask for low as it's just a decent wireless sport earphones. good fit, has some extra pair ear buds."
1208,5.0,"Sound Quality- Awesome with great listening experience especially when you're working out.

Noise cancellation- Fine, but could've been better.

Moisture Wicking- Good enough to keep it unaffected.

Charging Chord- Too small, may be made so because it's compatible with any charger and they just had to keep a dummy.

Overall nice & useful as it clings to you through your workout session."
1209,4.0,"The product is super but it is not robust. The earphones does not last long. I bought it on Sep 2018 and replaced it since one earpiece was not working within 4 months of purchase. The customer support is excellent but it takes 20 days time for the overall process. Again after 9 months of puchase, one piece is again not working. Sound quality is awesome. One cons is there that while calling, the other person recieves the sound too loudly any it irritates the receiver."
1210,4.0,"Some times sond lags
Bass is good but could be better
It gives u premium feel
Very light weight,You have to handle with care
battery life is also good
NOTE: If you are purchasing it for playing PUBG mobile then dont purchase any of bluetooth earphones go for wired ones.You can see some videos to know more about PUBG gameplay with bluetooth earphone
At last posting some pics do check it out.😊🙏🙏🙏"
1211,4.0,I'd rate it 8 on 10. The sound is too bassy but u just need to tweak it in ur phone's equalizer and its good to go. I'd say its much better for watching movies than music. For the price its a major go!
1212,1.0,"Don't buy this product if you're using it on daily purpose, After few months headphones automatically stop working, They will replace your product no doubt about it but it happened with me twice and they give replacement two times but there service is very poor, If call customer service center no person will pick up the call , Rarely they give response to you and i got 2 time fault in my headphones and i am regretting now , Go for another headphones this one are useless"
1213,5.0,"Sound is good... Extra bass is really extra(more then necessary)...so it is a little bad...
But worse things are
1)mic quality and position are too bad
2)ear speakers are too heavy and design is somewhat that do not fit to each and everyone
3)there is nothing like noise cancellation...its just noise isolation
4) length of cords is too much....
Overall review👇
Boat produces better wired earphones then these"
1214,4.0,"Ill give you honest review about this earphone. Excellent performance. Battery life very good. You can use whole day. I ordered 3 at a time from myntra at 900rs. That's was a very amazing offer on it. 2 connection works perfectly. But sometimess it gets auto disconnect but again it gets connected. But this is a case of one of my earphone, not with every earphone. I have all three colours. I'llI recommend you to buy this, as at this price you will not find any better earphone. Overall value for money."
1215,2.0,"Sound quality is not so good and not so bad, I'd say average. Bass is good but not so strong with treble. But the main problem is the durability. In 3 months, battery started draining in an just an hour long usage and also phone calls stopped working. This is the second time I'm having a terrible experience with BOAT earphones, earlier with a different model. I'm really starting to think if they're worth it because of this durability concerns."
1216,3.0,I used this product for like 6 months. In between one side of its earphone stopped working but boat team is too responsive as they replaced this product with new one. Sound quality is good but if you want better quality would recommend for other product. Battery life is best even using for so much of time. But facing difficulties as there always some kind of issue happening again and again. Other then its fine if it is bought under sale.
1217,3.0,"+ves
Works very good for Bass. Sound is a bit low but still okay. Very clear sound. No disturbance at all.

-ves
The one I didn’t like is the design. It doesn’t fir in your ears properly. It keeps falling down from your ear. The rubber grip doesn’t hold the earphone in your ear. Should definitely be redesigned. Also the soft part of the wire is little long and looks weird when wearing."
1218,4.0,"I bought it for 999. Sound quality is really good and good grip on-ear. the battery life is approx 2 hour. Earphones quality is good with strong magnetic lock... Straps is good quality and the earphones wires are too good... Buttons quality is good.

overall a good earphone in under 1000."
1219,1.0,"The product got dysfunctional after a few days of purchase. Registered a complaint regarding the same and they opened a ticket for me. The ticket took a lot of days to resolve and finally they sent me a replacement. However, the replacement has a major defect associated with it's charging port. The original boat USB does not fit into the port rendering the earphones as good as dysfunctional. Highly disappointed with the product and the service."
1220,3.0,"I read somewhere that BoAt products lead to drop in pricing by JBL, Jabra and others. Now I know why. At much less cost the headset delivers. I am facing a problem in charging. Full 100% charge lasts easily for a day. But next day it shows 80% charge and after a while drops to 20%. I have never seen 75% or 40% charge, it is 100%, 80%, 20% and Off. Will update after contacting customer support."
1221,5.0,"I got it for 1000 which is great getting this earphones at this price is really great .
sound quality is also good , base is really good here , the quality of sound is also good
battery life: it last long for like 5-6 days for 1-2 hours per day usage ."
1222,2.0,"Audio quality is good. Voice is clear. But the main issue is with battery.
For my case battery shows 40% balance. As soon as I connect it for music battery % drop to 20% within 5 sec. And within next 45 sec device get off."
1223,3.0,Basic wireless headset with mic. Sound quality is average. Had expected good bass as its from boat.. but was disappointed with the bass as well as the sound quality which sounded artificial. Batter backup is good and also the make quality is good. A 3 star product.
1224,4.0,Got these@999rs.Noise cancellation is not as expected.and few days of usage the grippers with ear pieces broken. length is good and magnetic lock of both ear pieces is helpful for holding these around our neck while driving.
1225,5.0,"The best part of this WBH is, it gives a clear and a deep bass with a clear and ample output of treble. Built quality at the par. And Seriously it is for rigorous workout. And i bought for 999₹,which is totally worth(Value for money).
But a bluetooth range is a bit less which can be neglected in such a budgeted price range..(100-200 zada lele bhai bus bluetooth range badha de)!!!!"
1226,1.0,After 5 months left side of bluetooth is not working and as mentioned it is having warrenty of 1 year so contacted customer service for help to replace the product Didnt get any help from them .The reply from them was to contact manufacturer this is overall Amazon's responsibilty to resolve all this issue .It is not customers responsibilty to contact manufacturer for this issues.Dissatisfied with Amazon service. I will never recommend Amazon.
1227,5.0,"Overall The Product is best at a price below 1000 RS.

The ear supporters slide on the surface of earphones which make it comfortable (so it could fit in every ear) but annoying at the same time(earphone feels loose and get out of ear).

Sometimes when you connect it after any pre connected device the volume doesn't vary to maximum as I need to reconnect it.
(It could be a case with my phone only(Lenovo K8 Note) but worth to mention the fact."
1228,4.0,"Not great sound quality. The bass is over amplified. But its a comfy fit and does an excellent job in cancelling out external noise. Some of the JBL headphones in the same range will provide you with better clarity of sound, wherein the mids are well highlighted along with the bass. But if you like fo listen to music with heavy bass, then these are definitely a better pick. Boat makes quality products for the given price."
1229,3.0,"Some cons-
1) The bass is way to heavy, if your device doesn't cone with any inbuilt equalizer to tone down the base a bit you might wanna stay away as the overall base is way to overpowering.

2) The Bluetooth connectivity is somewhere along the bad side, the connection sometime gets weakened while carrying the phone in trouser pockets.

Still somehow for the price range these earphones do pretty much what is needed."
1230,5.0,"Pros:
1.Easy to wear, Fits well in ears
2.Noise cancellation is good.
3.Sound Quality is better.
4.Battery life is great.
5.Available at reasonable price.

Cons:
1.Bass could have been better
2.Look is not so good as wire is bit long in front."
1231,1.0,I expected a lot from this one as fst time I was spending more than 1000 RS for this..But it's not worth the money... In noise u barely hear the sound bcoz volume is very low....sound quality also I didn't find very good...
1232,1.0,"I have bought 2 of this headsets recently.. sound very good for the price.. one headset is still working fine, the other one's bettery life drastically reduced, infact it's really a damaged battery.. i don't recommend this product because of the poor quality checks"
1233,5.0,"I didn't expected too much at this price range but I ordered it.
But Sound quality is awesome .
Bass is also superb.
battery life is also good. I have used for 4 hours approximately but not charged once.
Very easy to use.
Easily connects to my mi phone and ipad.
Go for it.
And at last, packaging and transport is good reached before time"
1234,1.0,"This product is not good and compatible with iphones. Sound quality is very low, on call sound is worst and phone battery is draining like anything. Twice ordered (using return option) but both the sets were same issue. I do not recommend this product for iphone. For other phone may test and try."
1235,4.0,This Bluetooth earpiece is great performing better than expectation. Battery backup is also great. Sound quality is great too. The ear buds fits well. The only problem I have is with the time it takes to turn off while holding down power button and the voice over when turning on and off.
1236,3.0,"Really liked the sound quality at this price range. However, built quality is not as expected. Device is quite delicate in handling. Should have been provided with improved breaded wires and metal tips. Overall, I am impressed.
PS: Bluetooth range should have been improved."
1237,1.0,"It's seemed supplier had unboxed it before because selaed was opened
2 major issues
1) within 4 m it starts to disconnect

2) when connect to mobile battery shows 100% after while it's show less

It's seemed supplier has placed used /faulted earphone"
1238,4.0,"The sound quality for a bt earplugs on this budget is quite decent. If you get it less than ₹1500 then you should go for this. Best product in this budget.
If you are a bass lover then you gonna love this. Also for calling and stuff it has got a mic which i quite good and gives a decent output to the callers even if you are driving."
1239,4.0,Battery does not last that long. I travel 4 hours everyday for work and I have to charge it for at least 10 mins to my way back home. It's none slippery and sweaty. The sound quality is good and block noise. Worth a buy as per the price.
1240,3.0,I have been experiencing range issues that whenever I put the phone in my pocket the music goes off. Bass feels too loud sometimes and suppresses the higher frequency sound but it's not very deep. But I guess it's okay at this price.
1241,5.0,"This is the 4th product of boat I have bought and this is as good as the previously bought headphones.

In this price range these are far better than any other brand.

Pros.
Battery backup is very good.
Bass is excellent.
Sweat proof.
Very good build quality.

Cons.
Packaging can be more better."
1242,5.0,"I just wanted to buy a good Bluetooth earphones in my budget.. And boat 255 is exactly that what I need.. The sound quality and nocie cancellation is awesome, really it's too good, company says with 10 mnt chrg it can play upto 45.but in my case the time was 85 mnt with 65% volume.. And with 65% volume you can enjoy 7to8 hours music..

Mujhe lagta hai boat ki is headset ki age isi budget mai or koi takkar dene ke liye hai e nehi.. Dude just go for it👍👍"
1243,4.0," I bought this back band in 999. Over all this neck band is good in all aspects . Sound is good. But I miss some functionalities which other brands give for eg tracks changing buttons , auto disconnect on when both ear piece magnetised with each other."
1244,4.0,"Excellent headphone for calls and music. But if you are gamer, you will face issue of sound. As it is bluetooth device, you will get sound delay by .5 sec. Like when i play pubg using this headphone, I get sound delay. So sometimes its difficult to spot any enemy in close range. No issue with headphone, it is because of bluetooth connectivity. And you gonna face this issue in every bluetooth headset. So go for wired if gaming your priority."
1245,1.0,Worst product used as of now.Bluetooth acts weirdly while put in pocket.Unable to hear while call/reset requires every hour if used more.Videos got mute after call.And most importantly warranty is miserable.Got a faulty replaced product after month of tracking and mailing.
1246,4.0,"best product within rs 1000, battery back up over 6 hrs after full charge, extra bass headphone with good audio.

But problem started after 3 months use. Volume up/down button not working. Send to service centre. Waiting for response after 15 days of dispatch.."
1247,2.0,This rating is wholly based on the duration they serve. I mean I don't know what is the problem with boat headphone. I bought two-three headphone of it in one single year. But after a few months their one side stops working. Again and again we had to apply for the replacement which takes a long time if you are applying online and support store as well.
1248,3.0,"This is only for walking, runners will have problems keeping this thing inside their ear. Okiesh base, notes really burst at highs, lows are ok, ok for a purchase if u are planning for general use or for walking purposes... runners stay away"
1249,3.0,"Overall Product rating is average but good at this price point (999).

Packing is very bad. It seems like a second hand product as the pack is almost damaged but no issues for the headset.

Sound quality is average. I can give a 3.5 rating for the sound quality. Built quality is good but the long wire is annoying. Design is not as good as other products in this price range.

Bluetooth connectivity seems fine. I didn't have any issues yet.

Overall I can give a 3.5 rating."
1250,3.0,"Product is good with its purpose but I'm very disappointed with its functioning. My left earphone has stopped working within 6 months. I'm trying to get it replaced and no one is there to receive my call on the other side, wow! I paid 1400 for this service!
Same case was with my friend's earphone. One side of it isn't working and no one is there to replace it despite the product is in the warranty.
Majorly disappointed with Boat!"
1251,1.0,Useless... Just started giving Bluetooth connectivity issues in a month of usage. Waste of money!!! The product was collected by the boat people it reached the service center but no one picks up the phone even if u call continuously. No one reply to the mails. Now I don't know where the headset is and what are they upto as it's been more than 4days that it reached the service center. Pathetic n horrible customer care and useless company.dont know hw r they surviving.
1252,5.0,"Just unboxed the Boat rockers 255
I am in love with the audio output.. Its simply amazing

Just a bit sceptical about the genuinity

Not sure if i have received a new unit .. the area where the wires connect to the earpiece seem like it was stuck for the 2nd time.

Please notice in the image how well the area where wire meets earpiece near the green arrow looks well but the one near orange arrow is not... There is a white ring around it."
1253,5.0,It does work in heavy rains...upto 6-8 hours of battery life with moderate call timings. Auto shut off.
1254,5.0,"Sound quality, moisture wicking are very great. Noise cancelation is good. But I observed switching off before battery is even more than 20%. Build quality and performance are good. And very comfort to use."
1255,3.0,"Find attached the photos, the box seal was open and also product was not packed properly. It seems some one has used it. Also the battery was fully discharged which was supposed to be fully charged and new product! Disappointed with the dealer plz do take a strict action on him. Attaching here the photos as proof!"
1256,1.0,"I am sorry to this Amazon.in and Boat Company. I found your product which is defective and fake.I purchased Boat Bluetooth Rockers earphones on 21st Jan 2020 and by this month it's just not working the charging slot isnt working.Later, I took the earphone to workstation the person told these is fake and duplicate one. Which is just sold at 250 rs out. Dear buyers check the review and please don't buy the product they sending you the defective and the fake ones."
1257,1.0,"I saw such review for the same product by one reviewer.....who complained that their ear piece was broken when delivered. Still I ignored and put based the same product...after opening the packet, when I configured Bluetooth with my phone, I found that in one ear, there was no sound...interestingly, I find that one wire is already broken....I don't understand that what is the meaning of that seal of the packet which guarantees the authenticity of the headphone"
1258,1.0,"I have been using this for over a month now, and find that, the power drains out real fast. The complete charge takes anywhere between 1.5 to 2 hours and , lasts for only, 4-5 hours. Today just on a 5 minute charge, it showed 80% charged!, Really??. While sound quality, noise cancellation is just about ok, the power back up required to make use of these features, is way too poor, and most of the time you will find the headphones switched off dead as a duck!"
1259,1.0,"Fake advertising.
Friends I have bought this product in January and it was nice but then when I sent it for replacement they send back a complete replica which looks same but cheap quality.
Apparently in the name of big discount they are giving out cheap and low quality products as my
brother have bought one in this month.
Weight and dimensions are completely different than before also says as baot rockerz only instead of boat rockerz 255."
1260,1.0,After your product start facing issue in warranty then it is worst servicer. Toll free no not working. When u fill complaint form they say invoice no is not vaild. I will suggest every body do not purchase this product. Boat rockerz successful work only for six months. It's under warranty. But boat customer service make ur life hell if u face issue.
1261,5.0," 1st impression bulit quality,sound quality godd..when compare to budget bluetooths,noise cancellation will be extreme it doesnt hear any noise...bass quality will bee veryy veryy high..its not good..that much bass quality for audio....finally ata this price itsss too tooo best product to buy..👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌"
1262,3.0,"You can take this as a bluetooth version of boat wired 220/225 headsets.Sound and bass is great but not clear in few situations.Noise cancellation was worst to the core voices of people 10m away from you is clearly captured and irritates you to the core, don't know whether it is a product issue which i received.I missed to notice with in the return duration otherwise would of replaced it.Now i need to reach support team for replacement."
1263,1.0,"We bought it on 16th July and got it delivered by 18th July. Was easy to set up. I have constant use of headphones in my work and have used multiple bluetooth headphones. But 21st August, one of the earbud stopped working and now both sides have stopped working. Expected it to work for at least one year. Also no place to return the item. What do you expect me to do with a 1000rs non-working headphones? I hope amazon/ the seller / the company replace the item."
1264,5.0,"Amazing product

My opinions after 1 month of use
Bass-10/10
Treble-9/10
Noise Cancellation-9/10
Built quality-10/10
Looks-9/10
Sound quality-10/10
Value for money-11/10

Go blindly, this is the best Bluetooth earphones at this price. I bought it in 999rs also get additional 200 cash back as amazon pay balance.

Great service by Amazon and boat, i got my order within 6 hrs through prime now app."
1265,3.0,"The music is good.

But, there is one problem the buzzing sound is coming fromm left ear bud, when music stops. It comes for 4-6 seconds and then stops. the sound is like if a CD is running in the CD-Drive

Please, tell me if that is okay?"
1266,4.0,"The product is good, but I did not like the product packing. The box looked very low quality. Apart from that the sound quality is good. Noise cancellation is average but the mike on the earphone is very bad. The mike catches all the disturbance which is nearby apart from your voice which makes the other person on the call not able to hear anything."
1267,1.0,"This is the 3rd time I have purchased this. The earlier 2 are working fine, that were purchased many months back. However, the 3rd one has stopped charging within 3 weeks of the purchase and now I am unable to find any option for return/refund/replacement."
1268,3.0,"noise cancellation is bad. mic captures all sounds, so while u are travelling it is difficult to converse.

sound is good, but battery life is poor. runs max 3-4 hours on full charge."
1269,5.0,"I would like to recommend this product under 1500/-,i bought this in 1200/-. You will not regret if you buy for 1500/-, sound quality is awesome the bass is perfect. Battery backup is said for 6 hours but you can use 10-12 hours for calls and some time of music or movie too.
I use to listen the music for 45-50 min and a YouTube for 3-4 hours a day. It long last from 8am to 8pm sometime you need to charge it for 10-15 mins it longs last for an hour or more."
1270,2.0,"It was dead after 4 months, it mentioned like it is water resistant, but when I went with dead headphones, they said water went inside so warranty won't cover. Service centre was worst, it is not boat service centre, boat tied up with Micromax which is worst service centre ever I faced. Not interested to give best service to customers."
1271,5.0,"I bought it under Sale at Rs. 899.00
And at this price is superb considering sound and built quality.
I choose this because I already have 2 boAt's wired earphones and they provide amazing quality at competitive price and best after sales serive."
1272,2.0,"Pros - sound quality is good and bass to
Cons - overpriced
Built quality is worst
Charging slot is too tight you might broke it if you try to unplug the wire
Wire is hanging on your face and neck higher chances of braking wire
Bluetooth range is not up to the mark
Battery indicator will always there to full you.
The real price should be 600-700"
1273,2.0,"Last July 7 I purchased boat 255 Bluetooth headset Rd.1499/- starting 2months working asome sound effects after purchased 3 months left side speaker not working I am totally upset .No service centre in Chennai, I searched in Google showing in amps skywalk Chennai there is No Response. service centre only available in Mumbai Howcan possible in Replacement"
1274,2.0,"Dead in less than one year! Not charging - no response - like it's customer service. Although sound quality and bluetooth connectivity is good enough, it's of no use if it stops working in less than a year. The company reared its head in the last few years though aggressive marketing push. but it could not create products which meets good standards. The customer service is not responsive at all."
1275,3.0,"Overall it is a good product. Connectivity is good. Battery life is also good as mentioned in the details of the product.
Con are sound is not that great. Battery level indication is not indicated properly. Most of the time it's between 100-80% n suddenly drops to 20% and then low battery. Voice calls are good but it picks ambiance noise very loudly. At the price range it is a good product."
1276,2.0,"Noise cancellation is okay.
Pros
1. Good connectivity and voice clarity
2. Easy to handle
Cons
1. Charging point very small
2. Wires may bend and get damaged
3. Magnet not effective and does not pause music when attached
4. Battery shows 100%, 80%, 20% and then straight off.

I think it will work maximum one year if we handle with care. I purchased for 999/-
Wait for this price and buy. Worth only this"
1277,4.0,"Pros:
Best at this price, got this at 999/-
Bass is very powerful
Range is also good (around 5 mtrs)
Supports Google Assistant
Sound quality is super rich

Cons:
Packaging was not good box was crushed from one side but still ear phones were safe
It will take time to get comfortable with as they only provided 3 size buds
Also there's no fitting clip in the box

Will update more after extensive use."
1278,5.0,"Amazing product by Boat supeb sound quality, more than average product quality feel of the product is good has a rubbish Matt texture
But the wire length is very long and that disturbs alot
Connectivity of the device is also good but hope on the newer version Boat uses Bluetooth 5.0"
1279,4.0,"This is the best Bluetooth Earphone at this price. Plus you'll get 2 years Warranty. So can't complain.

Battery life is not that impressive though, so keep that in mind before buying it."
1280,1.0,"Within 4 months one side of earphone stop working . .and when I contacted customer care of Amazon they provided me wrong no of boat customer care . .and called them several times but they were pathetic on call
Some time put my call on hold and one person was so pathetic that he was singing on call speaking very slowly . .I asked him to atlest give call to some one else but he denied said do what ever you can do we can not help ."
1281,5.0,"Brought this earphones for 900 during amazon sale. Great value for money. Fits the budget with average sound quality, only issue is with the ear buds it starts to hurt your ears after long use. Great battery life goes on for 4-5 hours as mention by BOAT. Far better than other bluetooth earphones. Bluetooth connectivity is also good with no disconnecting isssues."
1282,5.0,"If you are music lover it is very convenient and excellent choice
The operation quality and price are reasonable
The battery back up is good
Clarity is calling..... Are v. Good"
1283,4.0,"using this product since one month,great sound quality,good build quality,
also flexible,battery backup is also good.
Only one thing i didnt like is bluetooth range..its not the best..but good..
Overall the earphones are great at this price.you will not regret after buying this."
1284,4.0,"The sound quality of the product is top class and the noise cancellation too. But the 👂 ear hurts once we give it a proper fix inside for a day or two.
Just a small suggestion, if u are buying the product just to sit and home or work and to listen to songs ...hmm look into some other product as long usages hurt the outer ear parts for some time . I don't know if it hurts in the beginning just because the product is new and isn't that much expanding."
1285,4.0,"I was actually in dilemma in buying this or MI. But took a chance. Surprisingly i didn't go wrong. As samsung phones has mild low sound output, even i these mobiles it sounded far excellent. Then i tried with MI, honor and other mobiles. It was outstanding. Bass punched my ears so good. High and mid tones was good but not awesome. Call quality is just fine. Overall best earphone for budgeted. Just go on, u will never get unpleasant."
1286,4.0,Got it from prime day sale at 999. The sound quality is great. It have 10 mm driver. I can compare with product like Sony 75ap which have 12 mm driver. One thing I don't like the build quality. Using cheap plastic. The boat package quality also poor. You can't even know if the earphone used before. There should be a particular boat brand seal on the package box. Best for bass lovers. Overally the product is best in this price segment.
1287,5.0,Writing this after 7 months of use first when i got it i didn't like it as it was very bass heavy headphone but after their burning period they were good Af but in last month got some problem with connectivity and battery charging so I made a complaint on their site and pick up was initiated by boat and now after 15 -20 days I recived a new replacement unit happy with their after sales service * THANK YOU BOAT
1288,4.0,"It's sturdy, sound quality is good, sound levels are also good, the mic is decent enough too for phonecalls. The only thing I dislike is that it's not very flexible. It will not fit in your jeans pocket."
1289,3.0,since last 2 days post charging blue light keeps on. it doesnt go of even when you turn the product off. also in last 1 day it has stopped charging and turning on. it is now dead. tried resetting etc.
1290,4.0,I have used it for 1 day and no complaints till now. Build quality is good. Very light weight. Sound quality is good. It has super extra bass so those who don't like extra bass have to think on it before buying. Battery life is also good 5hour 35 minutes. Saw 2 movies in a day along with attending calls. Charging time is approx 2 hours. One of the good features I like that when you connect to android phone it shows headphone's battery icon next to bluetooth icon. That battery icon show how much charge is left.
1291,3.0,"It doesn't support noise cancelation. The person on the other end will hear the surrounding's noise more than yours and in a closed cabin, it will echo. Not recommended for calls. But for hearing songs, a great product!"
1292,1.0,"Bought this set end of October 19, it is majorly malfunctioning with many drops in connectivity. For this price, the performance and life is very poor. There is no redress possible for online purchases so its money wasted. I would recommend go for another model/ brand. This is a let down. Sound quality and sound blocking features were very good but if product has such a short life then it is a major pain. look for better products."
1293,2.0,"Pro's - Packaging, easy wireless syncing with laptop/android, noise cancellation, battery. Cons - Extremely bloated bass which makes it hard to listen to music to, poor mic which attracts complaint of poor sound quality while using phone/skype. These headphones are useful for sports/workout only. Not for serious music listening or any use which needs use of the mic."
1294,5.0,"Connectivity is not good, can connect two phones at a time but seems to loose connectivity every now and then.
battery life is good it last almost for a day.
sound quality is nice and loud."
1295,1.0,Sound quality is awesome but today I had kept it on charging & the side on which there is the charging port & other buttons... the headset melted & it's not even working now. Melted on charging... it became so hot that it could not be touched. Posting a photo so that all can see. 1 star coz of poor quality of material & build which melts in a month when just kept for charging
1296,3.0,"I have been using this earphones for about 7 months.
The left ear piece has stopped working already.
Till it worked, the sound and performance is all adequate for you in the price range.
The bluetooth works fine, but not good while travelling.
The wires annoy you most of the times.
Now I must say, there are better products out there in the market. You could consider this a least resort."
1297,5.0,Good Wireless Earphones but if you buy for playing games like pubg mobile pls don't buy any wireless earphones go to wired earphones they gives you better experience. The sound quality is excellent and noise cancellation is working properly on crowded places. Noise cancellation is work only when the phone is near. Bluetooth connectivity is excellent. Go for it it's worthy..
1298,1.0,I think i got a wrong product because day by day its ink is disappearing day by day and it been a month I m using it I m very disappointed with this product I have seen this kind of product and their BOAT ink is still visible with bright white colour and they have bought around 3 to 4 month ago I want an action against this thing and I hope you will understand my situation because RS1000 is the money I have spent on this thing .
1299,5.0,"Value for money product.
Nice built quality.
Sound is awesome, bass is also too good.
My battery lasts around 3-4 hours on loud sound on a full charge
Durable product
Go can definitely go for it 👍🏻"
1300,1.0,"I would not even give 1 star to this product.
Within 2 months it had battery issues and even after replacement its not working properly.(One side not working)
On top of that these people won't respond to your call or call you back and don't even respond your mails.
Worst product with worst service"
1301,5.0,Overall good product...Base and sound quality is awesome. Noise cancellation is okay...You can increase the base by exchanging the medium ear buds with larger ear buds which comes along with the package...Earpanels consists of magnets behind them which is pretty good... Highly satisfied with this product...Would recommend others to buy it...But the problem with the package was that I ordered for neon colour and I got black colour. ..I don't know why...
1302,3.0,"Ok product

After 100 it got to 80 and then 60% and then completly gone.

Software seems to be not acurate otherwise sond, noise and Bluetooth is ok. Overall ok to have in this range."
1303,1.0,"Even though sound and other features are nice, the battery life sucks. It shows 80% in phone, and with in minutes it will be down to 20% and will turned off. Not sure if it is defective product or the model.

Adding to my earlier review, this ear phone is not getting detected in any new devices after it got connected to first phone. Such a pathetic experience, first with battery and now with Bluetooth."
1304,3.0,"Yaa,product quality is not that much Good,it was showing the Bluetooth range is approximately 10metre but in my case it is working well within a range of 3/4 metre,if I go beyond this range the music/Calling quality is very bad.I don't know why the company like Boat having this much poor music Quality,But is doesn't satisfy value for money.Thank you..😟😟😟😟"
1305,5.0,"I recently jump on boat bluetooth, previously I am using boat wired headphone. but I am fan of boat product. It has
great noise cancellation
best bluetooth connectivity
perfect sound quality"
1306,4.0,boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
1307,4.0,"Excellent for the price..... much more of what i expected for the price.....
Sound is good, quality is good..
I would recommend buying it...
The only concern is i was not able to register the item on boat website for warranty.
Also in was not given choice of colour.... red that i recieved is also goog lookin...."
1308,4.0,"noise cancellation was worst
while listening music connectivity was good but when I use for call after 15 min next person cannot hear our voice not at all.
bass is great but it direct impacts on ear drum.
Actually I need Bluetooth earphone for call but that purpose was not solving so I returned it .
I have return earphone on 4feb 2020 till today I didn't receive my refund . what is this Amazon doing ... when I will get my refund???"
1309,1.0,"I recently ordered this product before Christmas I just used it for 2 days ... now it’s no longer working anymore I spent Rs1300 just to listens songs for two days wonderful . now they are not ready to replaced either just keep talking about return window ... comon
I didn’t aspected this from Amazon.
I will never order stuff again in future from amazon m done. I guess I should delete my account now if they didn’t value me as their customer."
1310,4.0,"Using this from 2-3 months. All is good apart from battery discharge. It 100% for 5 hours and then in one hour it will 0%. I don't think its a big deal and this issue is there when I bought it.
As per its design it can be use in gym with different exercises for that I have to set it above my ears sometime and sometime opposite of it.
I won't recommend for long hours uses. It will cause pain in ears."
1311,3.0,"Product is overall good, with only one issue that I have observed in the boat product, that mic is not that strong. You have to keep juggling your mic, so that other person can hear you. The mic captures more noise from outside and I guess it doesn't do noise cancellation properly at all. I do not have a choice to return it after 2 months of use."
1312,3.0,"The problem is that after use for 2 days on charging it shows 100% and 80% always. The point is that it doesn't shows 20% charge even it is so, on its place it shows 80% . This was the main problem. Another problem was that while on a workout suddenly the earphones stopped working even though it had battery.also one side of earphone was not working when I ordered it for second time"
1313,4.0,"Sound quality and bass quality is good. It has a passive noise cancellation, not active. The ear phones fits snuggly in the ear, however they sometimes cause a feeling of ear blockage or pressure.
Bluetooth connectivity is good. Range about 10-12 feets.
Mic quality is not good and one has to repeat multiple times to make other person understand.
Overall its a good product, in this price range for active gym goers."
1314,1.0,"Right side ear bud stopped working , and when claiming warranty then it was unable to process ,also customer care no is not valid . Very bad experience with this product , as mentioned above it's comes with 1 year replacement warranty, but don't get tempted that's all lie"
1315,3.0,"The sound quality takes a big hit. I play have a lot that requires me to listen to audio ques, and I enjoy listening to music. Both of them were affected by the use of these. Also the ear plugs were slightly large and the rubber stiff enough to hurt my ears after continuous use"
1316,5.0,"I like the overall sound quality of the product, just that you have to push to buttons for a few good seconds to power on or off or change to a next track. And that's not too comfy when you're on a treadmill"
1317,2.0,"The product is only good for listening music, not meant for phone calls, there is lot of noise to the other person. Voice quality is very slow and poor to the other person over the call. cannot be used for phone calls at all. i feel it is over price for a single use of listening music or watching videos, better products are available in the market at much cheaper prices. i guess the prices is double its selling price on amazon."
1318,5.0,"I was waiting for a deal for this product and finally I ordered it for just 899 rupees on prime day sale, great product with awesome sound quality. Battery performance needs to be done."
1319,3.0,"I purchased from primeday offer of 999.
1. The charging point cover will break in few days.
2. Noise cancellation is very poor.
3. The Bluetooth coverage is max 10feet and after that signal lost.
4. Will connect to single device at a time. Boat's claims is false for 2 device.
5. Sound quality is very good for watching movie.
6. The device worth in between 500 to 700 range rather 1200 or 1500 rupees."
1320,4.0,"Worth for the money, Battery is great 5 to 6 hours, and good sound quality for this price. The best part is if you charge the headphones for just 15 to 20 mins after the battery drains out you can use it for another 1 to 2 hours."
1321,4.0,"Awesome product at this price..the sound quality is very nice, noise cancellation is very effective which makes it very useful for those who use it while travelling. The ear support curve is very comfortable, you can use it for hours without having any pain in the nearby area. Overall good product, stand very high amonst his peers."
1322,4.0,"I m purchsng dis product fr secnd time. Dis is a awsm product, fr travelling prpose. Those r mad of music, they might gt some negative points. Packng can be much bettr compr to the price. This headph is hlpfull fr gymng n running... For me I am very satisfied..."
1323,5.0,Quality is very good in this price range. Bass is superb. I mostly use it for workouts. It does the job well. I face problem about noise cancellation as the other person on phone always complaints about unnecessary sounds from the sorroundings when I take a call outdoor. Service delivery from boat is amazing and satisfactory. They replaced my headphones after 3 months as one of the buds started sounding low.
1324,5.0,"Received the package on time.
The headphones package is basic.
No case which is little disappointing.
1.Sound quality is awesome,bass is really nice, sounds is loud.
2. Call quality is also nice.
3. Bluetooth range is not so good.
4. Battery life is awesome. It last for atleast 6hours of music.
5. Durability is also nice, as it is also water resistant so a big plus point.

A must buy budget headphones at this price range.
So a big 5*"
1325,4.0,"Rated it 4 stars only because of one reason. While being on a call at a noisy place, the person on the other side experiences a lot of noise. Similarly, while recording sound, it catches a lot of noise from the environment.

Otherwise very convenient because of being wireless."
1326,5.0,"Basically product is awesome .but don't buy this product in 1500.just put this product in cart and wait to price low.when any offer come and price till 999 ,then buy it .it is good in this price . although it is good product . important note your first check boat service center in your city before buying if it get damaged within one year you can go to boat service center and then your product maybe replace ya correct on that's place .best of luck."
1327,1.0,"Totally disappointed with this product on amazon....

No proper bluetooth connection..
No noise cancellation...
No battery backup...when my battery goes to 80, it doesn't work....only i can use this bluettoth from 100% to 80 %

Since i lost my amazon packing cover, i couldn't exchange /return as well even though i have return duration.....☹️"
1328,4.0,"A review on 10 days usage. If you are buying this product under 1000 then it's a great product. Not worth if the price is more. So buy it in a sale deal. Bass is good but not great, if you are a bass lover then don't buy. Battery back is pretty decent. Mic is ok. People on the other side get to hear you but not so loud."
1329,3.0,"All other features are good except the Bluetooth connectivity. The Bluetooth connectivity is very poor and the range of the bluetooth is not at all good, you will understand this when you make a call. Leave your phone while talking and walk for some distance the voice will start breaking and the person who is on a call will not be able to hear you.
If you're buying this only for calling then definitely it's a wrong buy."
1330,2.0,"+ Decent quality, average sound, light weight and good battery life last full day mostly & charges fast.

- too bassy & muddy vocals, low BL range, average mic, in-ear peice not comfy enough for long hour listening.

= For 1k it is ok for commute listening and answering call."
1331,5.0,"Pros:
-Can connect to multiple devices at a time.
-Great quality as per the price
-Good Bluetooth range
-Audio controls are decent

Cons:
-Not waterproof"
1332,2.0,"Poor connectivity, even distance is less than 2ft. Voice break in call and sometimes in music. Tridled with few different phones to make sure no compatibility issue, but all time connectivity issue. For this high price, not upto mark. Box packing was used. Seems like supplier keep rotating faulty used item."
1333,2.0,"Perfect and strong build but sound quality isn't enough.

The metal was too strong.
It is Water resistant #tested
Even after I've met an accident its still working perfectly.

But the earpiece was too big and it may cause pain in the ears.

Doesn't fit while sleeping or wearing a helmet.

Sound quality was much better..!!
A bit noisy

But everything else is perfect..!!"
1334,5.0,"This is the best quality earphones with great noise cancellation technique and very good sound quality. It's only drawback is it's great noise cancellation technique itself because I bought it for using while driving as I get too many calls, but while driving I'm not able to listen to the sound of other vehicle or horn. But in all its really good unless you're driving."
1335,5.0,"Quality is great, the cord is longer than normal and headphones have held up for months of hard use at gym, running etc. with no damage whatsoever

Sound is warm and full, the highs are not annoying and the bass isn't overemphasized which allows you to listen to them over extended periods of time. Probably the best sounding pair of in ear headphones I've ever owned"
1336,4.0,"Purely from an audiophile perspective, these headphones aren’t great

However if you are looking for decent sound on a budget, these are brilliant, bass is good, treble is a bit on the lower side, the fit in the ears is a compromise"
1337,1.0,The product I received was a used one. The sound quality s very bad.. I had to keep the maximum sound in both my mobile and Bluetooth device. When plugged into hears and wearing helmet it gives a mild pain.. Waste of money...
1338,4.0,"An average product or NOT worth for Rs.999/-. The maker doesn't know how to fix the control of bass and treble. However, my son enjoying it; because his favourite teacher owns the same."
1339,4.0,"*The noise cancellation and sound quality is perfect. It has deep immersive base.
*The build quality is outstanding along with the neck band.
*Decent Battery life
I couldn't get a better in-ear bluetooth headsets since I got it for Rs.999 in a sale
THE PACKING COULD BE IMPROVED THINKING THAT IT IS A 1.5K WORTH HEADSET!!"
1340,1.0,"Worst product delivered by Amazon, it's been just a month and my product became faulty. There is no sound from one ear piece and amazon kept return or refund for only 10 days. Worst. We buy a product by paying a huge money and they provide us faulty product which wont work after 1 or 2 months."
1341,5.0,"Good noise cancellation, very good sound. Good battery life. WOrth it, a mjst to have.

However, it cannot connect to multiple devices (e.g. ipad and iphone ) simultaneously like plantronics."
1342,5.0,"I didnt expect this much from boat.
I got this for 1499
Sound quality is good and the Bass is deep( great)
Fits so perfectly
Buttons are very reliable
Battety is good ( only used for 2 days)
Its very worthy on this budget...
Honest review"
1343,2.0,"Please remain cautious before buying this headphone set because in my case, the left earpiece has stopped working in under 3 months of my purchase. There is no support from boat either. No responses and pick and drop facilities make all hopes dilute. Really disappointed in boAt's customer service.
#shame #boatisnotgood #badexperience"
1344,5.0,"The value for money is amazing. The sound quality is at par with Sony earphones worth 3K although it breaks a bit at higher volume. The battery backup is decent. I use it everyday in office and elsewhere and one charge is enough for a full day. The build quality is decent for the price, the charging point lid is very flimsy and could be improved with a better one.

All in all these earphone are worth the money."
1345,5.0,Comfortable to use. Everytime connecting to Bluetooth is easy. Noise cancellation is much better than many other Bluetooth headphones out in the market. Battery charge lasts a long time.
1346,4.0,"Merits:-
1. Been using it for last 5 month. The earphone's sound and the bass is mindblowing.
2. Once if u fix the earphone into the ear you can't hear anything from outside even without playing songs.
3. About the charging, they have mentioned 6hrs standby but it will be upto 7 to 9 hrs also if you are using it continually.
4. Sweat proof is also awesome, Very flexible, weightless.
Demerit:-
1. Ear buds are not perfectly fit but u can enjoy enjoy the music."
1347,4.0,"Pros:
1. Superb sound quality considering that it's a wireless earphones
2. Comfortable to wear
3. Bass quality is also nice
4. Battery backup is very good
5. Noice cancellation is pretty good too

Cons:
1. Sometimes Bluetooth connectivity fluctuates and it disconnects/reconnects automatically
2. Cannot wear while Jogging unless you find a way to stick them to one place. While running it tends to bounce off and eventually drops off from your ears"
1348,3.0,"The sound quality of the earphone is good. The base and the noise cancellation is commentable. But I am not Satisfied with the products durability, just usage of 6 months and one side of it is not working. I really am a BOAT fan, but this product didn't survive as per it's name and money. You will find better earphones in same price range or you may have to Shell out a little bit more. Overall rating is just above average for this earphones just because of the durability."
1349,3.0,"Pros - Its Great product with great Sound Quality, Bluetooth Connectivity.
Cons - Noise cancellation is worst, Other person on call get every single sound of surrounding except the person who is speaking :),
And After use of 6-7 month Sided earphone then is complained and get it replaced but again after use of 3-4 months same issue reoccurred. So you can assume your earphone has got life until it has warranty."
1350,5.0,"Pros:
1. Good sound Quality with great base.
2. Can feel music, great hearing experience.
3. Great battery life, lasts for almost 6 hrs. charging speed is quite good, takes 2-3 hrs to fully charged.
4. Light weight, ear fit is good.
5. Noise cancelled is awesome.

Cons:
1. Durability would be concern, needed to be handled with care.
2. It's water resistant not waterproof
3. Wires seems to free fall n stretch, it would suggest to tie it with neckband to avoid the same."
1351,3.0,"Can't use when jogging. The base keeps flopping and sliding down your neck and tugging at the earphone which disturbs the sound experience. I know that these are not ""sport"" earphones, but even regular earphones are less of an issue in this, and having Bluetooth earphones that don't suit exercises defeats the purpose of using Bluetooth."
1352,1.0,"I purchased boat rockersz 255 during 2018 and that impressed me the design and sound quality. I brought one more during this 2019 sale for 899 Rs. but there is a big difference in both the products. First of all when it connects it should say ""You are connected to Boat Rockersz 255"" but 2019 sale product skipping "" 255"". looks like it is first copy."
1353,4.0,"Nice product... but a bit high price.It could have much better sound quality at this price. I have always loved ""Boat"", it is one of the best product of boat but could be better. Sound quality is average... not upto the mark. I was expecting it to be more clear
with better base n treble."
1354,3.0,"Using it since last one month I purchased it for Rs 949.

When I purchased it I received a good packaging but inner box was tempered and earphone was missing. So I contacted customer care and they sent another without any hassle.
Now Coming to product: I am using this same product for last one month and performance is good . Runs for 6hr continuosly when charged fully.
Voice clarity is moderate. Over all value for money."
1355,2.0,"My Order was not for Neckbank in Ear Headphone. But what I Received was NeckBand Headset.
Picture shown in Image is different and what they deliver is different.

Even this Neck band is also not flexible it's just like you are having U-Shaped sturdy pipe is on your Neck.
Mike is not near your mouth as it's attached to neckband, so you can't use these headphones for communication."
1356,1.0,"Product quality is cheap. I got my product replaced twice, one time from Amazon and Second Twice from Boat. The Second time, the product started showing problems from the very Day I received the product. I have again asked for a replacement. There is no response from Boat, it's more than a month now. Talking about product deliverable, Sound quality is ok. But considering other options available at that price point, it's below average mark."
1357,1.0,I bought these earphones few months back. The sound quality was good but the earphones were damaged within 6 months. Both the sides are not working. The 1 year warranty seems like a scam as even after registering a complaint no boat executive gets back. On calling customer service the calls remain unconnected and there is no follow up from them. Please don't buy as earphones have no longevity and getting through customer service is a pain.
1358,3.0,"The sound has more of bass and very little treble effect. If you like to listen to your music with slightly higher setting of treble, you will be disappointed. Battery is very good and so is noise cancellation. It's quite big and sturdy though, will not go unnoticed."
1359,4.0,At this price range i think this one of the finest headset available in market at present. Easily runs for 5-6houra in single charge. Voice call quality is nice. Music quality is satisfactory. Bass level is not that great but it can be adjusted using equaliser so its a great piece. Go for it. Its deserves value for money tag definitely.
1360,4.0,"Sound Quality : The sound quality is very good... Good baas... At higher volume the bass tends to overpower the vocals but at this price point the audio quality is very good.

Battery life : takes around two hours to charge completely. I do not use it continuesly but it can give you around 6 hours of music playback and talk time included.

Durability : around the neck design allows the earphone to be used freely... making it tangled free... durability of the wire is also very good."
1361,5.0,"I can say 1 thing , just blindly buy this product. I buyed during the offers and I got this at very less price 999. The bass n sound is simply awesome. Don't waste more money on other headsets .it's the very best headset and you will love it ."
1362,1.0,"product is gud but it dnt show the exact battry lyf left on ur earphn,if u""ll charge 10 mints it will show 80% but within 10 mints of use the battry will drain.
so need improvement in dis area.
after 4 months of usage its not at all working,tell me wat to do"
1363,3.0,"Faced 2 issues :
1. I tried all three different sizes of earbuds but they don't fit in perfectly in my ear and keep falling out.
2. While taking a call, the other person keeps complaining that my voice is echoing. I like to use earphones while taking a call, so half the utility of these is lost."
1364,5.0,This is a good buy at a discounted price. Noise cancellation is awesome and you might have to struggle a bit to adjust it in the ear. Dont use for a long time because it starts paining. The design of the ear plug needs some improvement to allow longer usage.
1365,1.0,"Worst Product I have ever come across.

Within 10 days of usage, I know it's a short time. However, after using it continuously, I would strongly recommend NOT to go with this product. They are churning number in volumes for mass market and manufacture lowest quality earphone.

Last night, I have kept for charge for whole night and it could charge only upto 40% and within next 5 mins the battery got completely drained."
1366,4.0,"I bought this in amazon sell with sbi card in 900 rs. First, the bass of sound is very good.noise cancellation is good. All other features like buildup quality, ear fitting, etc are above average. Not bed but don't compare with costly one. Finally one line- good one batter then all other brands up-to 2000-3000. Value for money if you buy up-to 1000-1100."
1367,1.0,"It is a like a product been purchased from palika bazar. Works inside the bazar and stops once we are out from there.
The device was working properly till yesterday. Yesterday ie 12.10.2019 was the last date to return the device in case of any issues.
Device has properly maintained its class till the return date and lost its breadth once return dates ended.. Great job 👍"
1368,4.0,"Yet to use long term, but build quality and sound quality is good. Face some loss in connectivity when the band is covered. Good to watch movies and music on the go. Not sure how it well it functions when going for a run or exercising."
1369,5.0,Using from. Past 6 months. Won't found any default in product. I got delivery on time. Very effective sound quality. Charge for 1 hour and it will work for 6 to 8 hours a day. I used to charge daily as I am travelling daily in local train for job so I require daily. Go. For it. Good product to have in your bag.
1370,2.0,Quality is not upto the mark. Instead you can just go with JBL wireless. It is just 300 rupees more than boat or you can opt for JBL wired which is just 800 bucks and way more worth than boat. Too much noise in the background. It even got replaced once but no use. Now they have only replace option and no refunds. Waste product. Don't even like it. It's just fallen in my drawer everyday and I don't feel like using it at all. DO NOT EVER BUY BOAT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR QUALITY.
1371,1.0,"No Battery back up even after full charging. No light indicator for full charge or no charge. It's working only if the device is connected to a charging port. No proper return policy. There is no option to replace the item with another brand, so i am forced to return it and compromise with the same brand which is no near my expectation. Go for a better brand."
1372,2.0,"I like the product but if u go for this much expensive Bluetooth headphones and within six months one of the earpiece got bekar so it's seems useless for me... I don't wanna give it more than 2 star, bought for my husband as a birthday gift but within six months, he has to again buy another earphones so go for sasta 50rs product but not for this one"
1373,5.0,"The best Bluetooth earphones in this price range
I get almost a day and half of listening to music and several calls as I moderately use it along the day
Fit is awesome
Sound quality good
Bass best in the range
Battery best in the range
Bluetooth connectivity fast AF range is weak though
I bought in a sale for 999₹"
1374,4.0,"everybody wants a quality and sealed packed product. i received this product with re taped pack. i ignore it and open and use. it has some problem sound stop intermittently. i observe that in offer amazon send minor defective product at first. please send properly sealed pack please.
i give request for replacement and receive the new but i request please send properly sealed pack at first.
product is good."
1375,4.0,"IF you are bass and Treble lover, these wireless earphones are for you. I bought this for Rs 1499/-. I m using it with an Iphone and i enjoyed the output.
Positive part: Great Design, Good output for given budget, Noise cancellation is good too.
Negative Part: I experienced Bluetooth connection disturbances wile exercising, U need to use equalizer settings if u do not love Bass and treble.
Overall it is a good product...."
1376,5.0,"Good headphone, decent sound quality, good to look but had been better if the neck portion would have been foldable/flexible wire, so that it could have been wrapped and kept in a pouch"
1377,3.0,"Pros:
- fast and easy connectivity
- sound quality is good
- bass is good
Very good product if you want to just listen tousic or movies..
Cons:
- Pathetic noise cancellation. Even the slightest nearby sound is AMPLIFIED
- Battery life is very very poor
- Charging time high.
Worst product if uiu want to use it for calls."
1378,5.0,"These are pocket friendly bluetooth headphones by Boat but only problem with these pairs is when you are in isolation it works awesome but when there is no isolation, thr other person on-call hears more from your surroundings than your voice.

Otherwise, very good earphones. Just go for it."
1379,5.0,"Overall best product by boat, but there is no any carry bag and things required so if any body assume that they are going to give you complete package then you may be wrong. They are not going to give you complete package.

Note:- it disconnect several times while using it."
1380,3.0,"The sound is not bad at all , but when you are calling someone it distorts a lot . The Bluetooth range is bad , for example if the phone is in my pocket and i keep my hand on the earphones it stops , which should not happen. That's the only thing which is vey disappointing."
1381,1.0,"Changing the rating to 1 star, it ran ok until it died. Company seems to be shur, not respnding on emails for warranty claim as battery died before 1 year. Amazon seems to be of no help in this and keep on screwing the customer with nothing but ' thankyou for ur patience and understanding' line in the script. Amazon seems to be passing time and not helping at all.. dont buy these or you will be screwed too .."
1382,1.0,"It has stopped working after 3 months. Please exchange this. I bought this because of the branch image of Boat in market. But its not like I was thinking. Please exchange my headphones. I am totally dissatisfied.

I have used the product very Gently. But still its giving problem. One of my friend told me that you can buy blue tooth headphones in 250 then why you are investing huge. I told him that this is BOAT. But I was wrong."
1383,3.0,"Excellent Battery backup - lasts around entire day for general, non continuous use.
Good sound quality...
Edit: After 7 months, one side not working. Raised complaint on boat website, awaiting response."
1384,3.0,"it has a great bass and to a great extent noise cancellation and decent sound clarity and mindblowing battery but the following dissapointed me though i tried a lot to adjust.
1.Bluetooth range not more than 10m
2. Pain in ear due the conical buds(can be removed)
3. very low quality and distoring mic. Other person keeps complaining about my voice.
4. The worst left side part is broken in 6 months"
1385,5.0,"Wow! More than what I expected.
Sound quality - 5/5
Bass - 5/5
Noise cancellation - 5/5

I received the product just some minutes ago so don't know about the battery back up. But I'm sure it must be good too.

Overall, it's just awesome in this price range. You should definitely go for it"
1386,4.0,"Sound quality is just awesome at thi price range...
Noise cancellation is not too good but it cancel maximum noise...
One demrit is that the battery life u can't rely on the battery indicator its shows that ur battery is 80% and in next half an hour it sudden fall at 20% or 30% nd after 5 minute it will switch off....
Overall at this price range it is awesome earphone...u can buy without any kind of doubt in ur mind..🙏🙏"
1387,2.0,"cons:
1. range is too less
2. consistency is poor, sometimes work okay sometimes very bad
3. Becomes irritating many times, had to be removed due to bad sound between telephone conversations.
4. doesn't fit good to the ears, it starts paining after a while.

I don't know why this is so popular product, its just useless. Money wasted."
1388,4.0,"worthy of Investment as it serves a nice audio output, negates the noise perfectly. Battery life is good as well (I'm not a heavy user so 5-7 hours is exceptionally good for me, otherwise depends on one's uses). However, it lags very frequently if connected to two mobiles at a time and you put it on hold for some time as well as you are getting continuous notifications on one or both the phones."
1389,5.0,"Received it timely as promised by Amazon. I am writing this review after using for months. Good sound quality with better effects. Bluetooth reception, very rarely you will get glitches that too during moving in the bikes. Very good feedback from the keys, good build quality, very easy to handle, suitable for workouts, cycling and jogging etc., Totally, it is worth of cost."
1390,4.0,"The quality of product is good. Ear bugs are also comfortable to wear and sound is nice. Working well with my MacBook, two other phones with no issues. It connects to one device only at a time."
1391,1.0,"Total wastage of money
Sound 0/10
Quality 0/10
Material 0/10

Not comfortable size also is too long for neck and earphones are not adjustable
And the worst part is you can not return the item once you purchased it you will be trapped total money gone to trash"
1392,1.0,"Bought it for 999 rs in Jan mid, 2020 deal. Going to return it. One side of ear piece is not at all working. Seems the seller is selling only defective items in the deal. Very bad"
1393,5.0,"I am using this product from last 4 month and got 1 replacement as well. This device is my second headphone.

What is best -
Battery life - 8 to 10 hrs
Durability - if you will use without folding wire this is great.
Sound - Amazing.
Pairing - you can keep pair with 2 devices like I continually use with cell phone and my Fire tv stick

What is bad - No noise cancellation so its bad when you will call someone as they will keep listen noise from your side whether your Tv volume is at 2 or 3"
1394,1.0,Purchased it on 26 oct 2019 as a gift to my husband But the product failed to satisfy our needs as it stopped working within three months of use Warranty should be specified so that we can get solutions
1395,1.0,Microphone of the product is very poor and noise cancelation doesn't work properly.. Other side of the caller is unable to understand what we are talking. There's no control to adjust the microphone settings or anything. Overall a poor product.
1396,5.0,"I was waiting for a few days before writing this.
1. Amazing sound quality for the price point. Good bass output without muddying the rest of the frequency. Descent mids and highs.
2. Really good passive noise cancellation. Couldn't even hear people talking next to me.
3. Good Bluetooth connection. Was able to step out of the room and still managed to maintain a descent connection through 2 walls."
1397,2.0,Sound quality is poor. bass feels completely absent. too much noise in music. treble is terrible. Bluetooth glitches during transit. Batttery life is great. overall not good product. you can use it for calling or watching movies but terrible choice for music. Don't buy this if you listen music all the time. Speakers are poor quality will give you headache after 10 15 minutes.
1398,4.0,"Creates problem if you are talk & put your phone in pant pockets. Other than that, sound quality is great for it's cost. Battery life is decent, but withers down though with time."
1399,4.0,"As expected makes life easy with two BT pairings with a single device, Voice clarity is good but Noice cancellation is not as expected. Otherwise Great product for its cost & better then competition"
1400,5.0,"It's Simply an Amazing Product for the Music Lovers who can enjoy the best quality of songs in travelling, gym workouts, or for mood change.

Loving it so much and i haved owned it at a reasonable price on Diwali sale. 200 % worthy You can go or choose for this 250 BOAT Sports Wifi Bluetooth headphones.

I can rate 100% sure for anyone who would like to purchase it or can gift for someone who love music"
1401,4.0,"Hi guys....the product is good. Gives a battery backup of around 5 to 6hrs and takes nearly 1hr to 1hr 30mins. You can use it while working out in the gym. The sweat doesnt affect the device.

There are some issues with the product. You can hear some disturbance many times. Bluetooth connectivity range is around 5metres only.

Overall a nice product at this price range. You can go for it if you are in a tight budget and also want a branded product."
1402,5.0,"One day delivery with free shipping (very fast delvry) thx amazon, i bought this model 2nd time, love it.. Worth product for 999rp... Base lovers go ahead... I am also base lover... Connectivity good, feel comfortable and stylish.. Boat rockerz thx for such a gud headset... 👍👍👍🙏🙏🙏"
1403,1.0,"Writting this review after one month of use. Initially it was very good. Battery life was awesome. But suddenly for few weeks i did not use it and now if i check it back its not Working.

When i keep it in charging then only its switching on. If i remove the charging it is dead."
1404,1.0,I have purchased this product recently and after limited use or just after 2th or 5th use i tried charging the headphones and it is not charging tried to write to customer case as the product is in warranty have failed to hear or didn't got any response regarding the same today i am writing this review after exculpating the issue 15 days ago still haven't received any revert
1405,1.0,As a bass lover i would like to say it is weak..They say it has super extra bass i say it doesnt even have good bass trust me bass is not good at all im a bass lover. Vocals are ok mic distorts. Voice is ok. Seriously if u love bass buy nu republic jaxx 3 instead of these they are far better for bass lovers plus vocals are also better i have used jaxx 3 also.
1406,4.0,I was right in budget and wanted to buy earphones while I saw this with good reviews... So decided to buy it... I can say that this is really good but I feel battery life isn't good .. max to max 5-6 hours ... Else everything is good
1407,4.0,It's my first day of use and the product is overall good as expected but just one dissapointing thing is the Bluetooth connectivity it cuts off in between which is not pleasing when your listening to songs otherwise the sound clarity and bass is no doubt quality and up to the mark just the connectivity factor is something which bothers me let's hope it gets better in days...
1408,5.0,"very nice product I am reviewing this product after using it for 2 or 3 months , sound quality is good battery life is of stander level including fast charging, built quality is also good , very light weight , flexible too. Bluetooth connectivity is not that much good as I was expecting for (some times I found issue to connect it from other rooms) OVER ALL BEST PRODUCT AT THIS PRICE SEGMENT."
1409,4.0,"Looks great, great build, light weight. Very long wires, Sound quality is moderate not up to the mark. Low Bass. Mic and calling functions are great. Boat is a trustworthy brand. Very very overpriced. Connectivity is good, easy to connect and use."
1410,5.0,Finest product from Boat as of now in this 1500/- range I must say. From bluetooth connectivity to noise cancellation everything is good. Currently the best bluetooth earphones.
1411,4.0,"Pretty sturdy for the price. But the funny part is almost 12 people at my work place have the same product and hence we all can't leave it anywhere even for a second .. Because it will be lost or exchanged 😁 which also tells us about the economy and quality, that the product provides.
The power button is a bit slow. Rest all seems pretty fine. It's the best thing at this price. It's very handy and durable at the same time."
1412,3.0,"Good but calling time many problems face ..noise cancelling is not working many time .and many time is microphone is not working
call karke baat karne somoy dosre phone par baat sonai toh deti hai lekin sound bohot kom hota hai ...isla microphone ka problem hga sayed nahi toh microphone quality ascha nahi hai
Warranty card and Where warranty my product"
1413,1.0,"I have purchased these earphones after reading all positives responses. But I had issue with battery life. The battery life is very poor. When I connected bluetooth, that time battery shown as 80%. After 20 mins it got disconnected due to low battery. And this happened every day. So within 3 days I returned it. I am regular & prime member of the Amazon. So, I am not expecting this type of product from Amazon."
1414,4.0,"The product is great at this rate(999/-).
Bass is awesome.
Quite good noise cancellation.
Battery backup is fab.

But the wires connected to neckband are quite too long, it keeps floating left-to-right while walking(if u haven't plugged into ears & it's simply hanging by ur neck) and makes ur walk uncomfortable/weird.
Still u can go for it. Company made no compromises on quality."
1415,4.0,"The Quality of the product is amazing and this is my first Bluetooth earphone. Completely in love with it, its always on my neck for the complete day and never feels like anything is hanging on your neck. Coming to the battery, it lasts for 4-5 hours on continuous use."
1416,1.0,"I gor first unit. I that sound was good but battery life was just 2 hours.

Now i got this replaces unit and sound quality is not good as first unit. Battey is also not that good. As per my experience the difference are in units itself. Same product has different sound and battery quality ."
1417,4.0,"BoAt packaging is worst. The headset wire got wear and tear ,and bend due to rough packaging.You can clearly hear the sounds of instruments during music but human voice is not clear... It is better if the makers avoid beep sound during volume adjustment..... The headset wire starting from the end of neck band can be avoided...better if it comes out little bit away from the tips..like in the Boult headset... overall it's okay"
1418,1.0,Stopped working after just 60 days of use. One on the right side is not working anymore. Customer support don't reply to mails.
1419,4.0,"Really loved the product.. the Bluetooth connectivity is just too good.. it easily connects with any android or iOS devices.. sound quality is a different level.. feels like you are in a theatre.the pricing is so reasonable. Having such a quality at such a price is something we don’t get easily.customer service is also very good. I had some issues with my device , I called the customer service and their service is was very fast."
1420,2.0,"To be Genuine ... product is ok...we can njoy songs but if you want have a call with this bluetooth you feel very uncomfortable as receiver is unable to here your voice if your are in traffic...you can talk only when your in a closed door...

Overall is ok for 999/-"
1421,3.0,Don't buy bass effect is useless plus no noise reduction. boat wired one cheaper than this price is having good bass. Amazon never test any product for the quality with their tech team. Only doing a courier job. Don't waste money with this product.
1422,1.0,"After connected its running very well but when I receive call bluetooth not woking I have tried more time but cant found the issue.

I replaced the product but now I am getting the connecting issue this headphones is not connecting to any device"
1423,3.0,I expected beter sound quality from boat which is 1st interms of sales but it is quite average and battery backup is 5 hours and charging time is 3 hours which is not suitable for regular users.
1424,4.0,"Like the sound quality ,and durability of the product, should have been better if the design of the earbuds were like of that of iphone earbuds, once inserted in ears you will not be able to hear outside sound."
1425,3.0,"Average Bluetooth ear phones, justify the price of 1K. If you are looking for convenience and freedom for tangling wire, certainly you can go for it. If you want great sound quality certainly this is not the one."
1426,3.0,"Got this for Rs.990 in sale, i purchased these phones fro my jog after my LG earphones stops working, it's serves the purpose for the price...but not satisfied with music quality. But can't complain due to the budget. You must spend 2500 bucks for music quality. Not a bad product also not great."
1427,4.0,Sound quality and noise cancellation is good... I hv faced issue while using it for calls...background noise is too much amplified for the other person on call and they hear background noise clearly rather than my voice... Needs to be looked into that... Otherwise it's good
1428,1.0,Product worked good for 5 months and then the right ear bud stopped working...so better to avoid it...even after handling with care the ear bud is very fragile. Pathetic experience with boat customer care..they work in BC age..no response from them to replace the damaged ear bud.
1429,2.0,"Cons:
1. No vibration on call.
2. 6-7 hrs battery drain in not use but connected state.
3. Wires are longer than it looks, so they are hanging around while in use.
4. Inear support is useless.

Pros:
1. Bought for 999 which just okay.
2. Sound is okay.

Would suggest Samsung Level U for 2000."
1430,3.0,Everything else is great but the major issue with this earphone is its very hard for ears and your ears will start paining within 30 mins of usage and i also tried all 3 earbuds which come from company but still the same issue. Also there's no refund policy from Boat only replacement will be given. So don't buy as I'm regretting my decision.
1431,2.0,"I purchased the product for 999 and I don't find it that useful as the sound doesn't come even when the phone is in the pocket. What is the use of Bluetooth headphones when Bluetooth doesn't even work properly.
Need a lot of improvement only keeping high rates doesn't make a product good
But when the phone is in hands it works properly so I particularly don't find it that useful.
Overall a below average product."
1432,2.0,"Hello People,
Earphones provides good sound and bass. Although it not worth to have Bluetooth earphone with battery drain issues and Bluetooth range is 1-2m.

I find earphone giving issues and glitches in connections in calls and sound after 2 meters.
Also Battery is below average with 2-3 hours max capacity.

Best of all is Amazon does not provide return on this product, only exchange option is availble.

Think twice before buying this product."
1433,4.0,"This is the best bluetooth earphone under 1k price segment. Offers good sound quality with perfect bass. Design looks cool and light-weight, overall its a perfect fit.
The only problem is with its ear log fit.
Go for it :)"
1434,3.0,Worst ever experience! The bass is too low! At full volume i feel more wanted and while traveling is too bad! Bass is too low! If i set minimum volume i can't hear clearly! This problem came even after replacement! I think this model itself have low bass! So finally j returned it! Suggest me some branded headphones under 1k..😒
1435,3.0,"The sound quality is good, stays firmly on the ear and battery life is decent. But, the turning on and off and battery low notification with voice is very annoying. The battery notification that appears on the phone jumps in large increments and is unreliable. Also this is unusable while running or riding as the audio gets distorted a bit under shaky situations which is I guess is the biggest flaw."
1436,5.0,"It fullfills all requirement of music lover, action movie lovers, those who talk for long and those who listens audio books.

Bass is high, it depends on choice. But it doesnt kill trebel, mid and high tones so listening is wonderful experience.

Connectivity is very fast and battery backyup is 6hrs+ in playtime.

Rest all is good."
1437,5.0,"Sound Quality is great, noise cancellation should have improved cause excpet my own voice my caller's hear others noise, bluetooth connectivity - sometimes it takes times to connect and also while playing a songs it disturbs with some terrific sounds like connectivity issues I have checked same with my other phone but same sounds and disturbance but not all the time hardly once or twice in a day."
1438,3.0,"I already have boat 510. It is just amazing in sound. Bass, durable and battery 🔋 life too.

So that i went for boat 255.
But it is too bad in battery life. Sound nd bass quality is also not upto the level of boat 510.
I just totally disappointed with this boat 255.

Just go for another. Dont come to it for its popularity. Cosider zook and Boult products in this price range."
1439,4.0,"I bought it at 899/- and as always Amazon was too good with it's 2 day delivery

By far the best budget Bluetooth headphones.
Good sound especially bass.
Ergonomically perfect.

Cons according to me only 6-7 hrs battery life , Bluetooth connectivity is pulsating sometimes happens rarely but it does,

Overall worth the money 👌👌👌"
1440,3.0,It is a problem with battery indicator.Battery indicator on mobile shows 100% or 80% only. Even if the battery is 50% or even less it still reflects 80% and so on. So it does not reflect the exact batterylevel. After 3months of use both the side earphones not working. First one side goes down and then second day other side
1441,4.0,"This wireless earphone is good product. You can't say it's the best...But yeah I got it in 999 and it's best in this range. If you're looking a headphone ideal for bollywood music, it's good to go. But if you love sufi, ghazals, semi - classical genre, you'll be little disappointed! But what would you expect under 1000 bucks!"
1442,3.0,Sound quality is good but when u r in very busy area like in railway station airport the Bluetooth gets disconnected.....😑. U have to connect it again and again or music gets stop overall it's good for ur daily purpose like if u are a college student it's best for u...👍 One more thing i want to mention that for calling purpose it's not so good...coz noise cancelation is very poor....
1443,4.0,I got this on 30th sep 2019 for Rs.899 the black colour verient the build quality is ok interms of price. call quality is really good if your device is in close range the sound quality is where I'm not fully satisfied the bass is ok but the vocals and instrument sounds are not that clear it feels like the base is suppressing the vocals and other instruments sounds.. But I have to say for the price of Rs.899 it's acceptable.
1444,5.0,"Super bass at an affordable price point. Boat Products have always been on their top when it comes to the materials they use in making their products outstanding with regards to it's built quality,the texture the finishing
All in all superb product at this price point"
1445,4.0,The earphones certainly delivered more than expected. The bass and beats are the highlights. Go for it if you’re looking for budget Bluetooth earphones. They are comfortable with good quality sound.
1446,3.0,"After 3 successful returns, again Amazon delivered this product with defect. The left earphone is generating less sound than the other one. I got this product at 999rs and delivered within 2 days. As the earphones are with bass so don't use it for long time."
1447,4.0,"Sound is good, Noise cancellation is good, some very rare time the other side of person is unable to hear my voice which may b due to my mobile network not sure. One thing designwise i wanna mention here which i little feel uncomfortable is the size of the earpiece which bulges out so much tat when wearing Helmet it gves a lot of pressure inside the ears from the helmet and it becomes air tight 😐 If Boat can make it little sleak or small in size!!"
1448,5.0,"No wireless earphone better than this one in this
Price range.
Its Affordable,easy to use while driving,sound quality also good.
The best thing is its very much durable.
I’m using is since 5-6 months and is working fine.
No other wireless earphone has worked this long for me.
Total value for money. Go buy it."
1449,4.0,"Average sound quality, You can't hear details because they have more bass so you miss the details, battery backup is very less approx 6 hours at 60% volume which is not good at this price."
1450,1.0,"I sent the product to Boat Service center Mumbai for a warranty replacement, they took completely 2 months for sending the replacement unit from 30 august 2019 to 31 october , when i opened the replacement unit package , WTF it was a used unit dirty , fully destroyed unit , unable to pair with my phone . Only takes charge .... BOAt cheated me in a drastic way , and my 1499 rupees are gone to hell........"
1451,2.0,"Overall worst product from boat,poor connectivity,it get interrupted 5-6times in a 7min songs and keep repeating that same irritating voice-you are now connected to boat rokerz 255,
Battery backup is good
Bass is so so
I suggest, choose any other product instead of wasting in it."
1452,3.0,"I bought boat bluetooth in the first week of August 2019 and have been using it from then. Quality of the sound and connectivity were awesome. BUT by end of December 2019, right headphone stopped delivering the sound. I had to use only one headphone from past one month.
Mentioned was one year replacement warranty. Hoping to get a replacement as soon as possible."
1453,1.0,It just 3 months and it stops working. One side speaker stopped working in less the 2 months and note if is not at all working. Trying to get replacement online from boat rockerz website but not accepting
1454,4.0,"I bought this product three months ago, and until now I'm satisfied with the performance. It's battery life is amazing, one single full charge can last upto days if your use is average hours per day.

Sound quality is good bass is little on the low side. It has water and sweat resistance, makes it very easy for me during exercise, without the fear of damage to my product.

It comes at an optimal range, buying it is win-win."
1455,3.0,Sound quality is decent for the price range it comes but not comfortable to wear for long time after 10-15 minutes your ear will feel pain i have other companies wire ear phone they are very comfortable so i can wear them 2-3 hour continually but customer service is good
1456,4.0,The product do not comes with item box case which i got when i purchased it from other e commerce site.... The discount was good but the sound quality is poor. Overall not a gokd deal for 1k price.
1457,4.0,"Overall it's a 'good' earphone but sometimes it doesn't connect easily with your phone you need to press the button multiple times you even might have to turn it off to connect it to your phone.
Noise cancellation bad in case of wind noise
If there's a strong breeze and you're wearing this earphone you can hear the sound of wind amplified.
But that doesn't happen often so it's okay with noise cancellation."
1458,3.0,"Sound is good, call vibration missing, Magnet is just for binding 2 earphones, not more than that.
As per general awareness, once magnet disconnect, call or play should be connected, but not works."
1459,2.0,"Please read it before you buying
1. Sound quality is good but not loud enough
2. Battery is good
3. Bluetooth connectivity is good
4. Wire is too long
But the main part, it is a headphone and you should put it on your ear, but believe me after using 10 min you feel pain in ear, frequently it fall from ear, it is not light weight so it irritating your ear and head. So please buy a light weight headphone to do the main job."
1460,2.0,"Let me tell you very frank bass is quite good not great, connectivity is worst, battery is average, expectations is high for my side as per brand but its response totally fail , disappointed me.last but not the least when i open the parcel seal is open and box packaging in parcel is damage."
1461,4.0,"I have purchased this product 2 months ago now after using i can say this nice product in this range...sound quality is good, just need to improve battery life bit more,once you charge you will get 2-3 hrs maximum backup.
You can add only one device at a time although there are other Bluetooth headphones comes with dual connection.
There is no magnet or any kind of knot so you have to be very careful every time when you are not using"
1462,2.0,"I bought these earphones one month ago and today it's one side Stopped working, overall headphones are best at this price, sound quality is also very good, bass is very high which is very good, but it's built in quality is somewhat low
As I said it's one side Stopped Working
But I claimed warranty and boat is now replacing me these earphones, hope the replacement should not also stop working"
1463,4.0,"Cannot receive whats app call using button on the head set. Alternatively whats app call can be accepted on handset then it automatically works on headset.
Other wise its a pretty decent buy for 999,00. Bass/base sound is more when on music or movies suppressing other music or vocal content. Bass lovers would love it."
1464,5.0,"Wonderful Bluetooth Earphones for the price, the sound quality is equivalent to my wired LG earphones and the fitting is good too(my wired boat earphones used to easily slip out of my ears) and for the durability will have to test for at least a month, for now they look good"
1465,2.0,"Battery life is very poor it takes around 1.5 to 2hrs to charge but battery backup gives only 3-4hrs
Sound quality is good and bass ok .
If you having a budget of 2k then Better go for New Realme wireless earbuds having fast charge and long battery life backup upto more than 12hrs in a single charge .
Realme sound quality is awesome and great bass with 11.2mm driver."
1466,1.0,"One of the worst product I have ever brought. In 3 months stoped working!. I recommend not to buy this earphone. Everything else like sound quality, noice cancelation are pretty good. But if the durability is less everything else becomes waste."
1467,4.0,You may get a defective product. Locate the nearest service center. Keep your bill with you. Keep the original packaging with you. They will replace it at the drop of a hat.
1468,5.0,"Gys sounds is very good ,can choose it blindly,bass very good in Bluetooth system,if damage after receiving or before receiving that others matter,but sound is too good.but sure register after receiving online."
1469,4.0,Bought Boats Rockerz 255 recently and its upto mark. Works flawlessly with my OnePlus 3T. Sound quality is surprisingly good with good amount of bass and treble. Also battery backup is good.Highly recommended!
1470,2.0,"Looks something else, company claims something else and the product is absolutely something else. It's pathetic. Fit-wise. Sound quality wise. Poor poor product. I mean, you price tag your product 3000Rs. Then give a flat discount of 50%. It is all only making a fool out of customers. You better give a product for 3000Rs only but give a satisfactory product. Have some ethics guys."
1471,1.0,"Actually I ordered this Bluetooth headset on September 11, 2019 .
And it was working good but on Jan 23 or 25 my Bluetooth headset which I ordered from Amazon headsets one side is not working an while buying the I saw there was a warranty of one year .
An the issue is one side of Bluetooth headset is not working I kindly request plz make a check on this."
1472,5.0,"Don't have much range. Fit well and i have got it with discounted price and that was awesome. Having average backup as per the the product description. For a normal user like me it is superb. For extra base, back up, design go for a different one."
1473,4.0,"The product is good for the price i paid 999.
but i have a doubt whether its an original boat earphones.
cuz the brand mark is nowhere engraved.just printed on the band.
and its a long than expected..
And Guys the battery backup is just 2-2.5hrs"
1474,5.0,"Very happy with the sound quality, I am posting this review after using the headset for almost 3 weeks. I am very happy with the battery backup for the headset.
Its ligh weight and foldable. Easy to carry in bag without any fear of damage. There are 2 extra pieces of earbuds of different size to fit your ear."
1475,1.0,"Not worth the price I paid. I bought it looking at the reviews. But I believe it's useless.
Sound quality is very poor. It's deep and not clear.
No noice cancellation happens
The plug support are so very low quality that my ears started to pain because of its hardness and non flexibility.
The string is too long which hangs out upto your tummy.
Useless product. Do not buy it based in reviews."
1476,2.0,"Got it for 899 still i wouldn't say its worth it.
It doesn't fit well in your ears. Keeps falling. The lock isnt that good.
The microphone isnt very effective it dampens your voice.
Since the voice cancellations is not good it becomes a task taking calls on this when you are on road"
1477,4.0,"Pretty good product. Clear sound.

Only complain I have is every time you turn it on it announces ""hello, power on. you are now connected to boat rockers"". Consider this announcement when you are halfway through in an important call and are connecting to Bluetooth now. Not that other parties hear the announcement but you don't hear anything from call while the announcement is on."
1478,1.0,"A nice little head phone, but only when it works. Within a month it stopped working. The warranty process is convoluted. Have to raise ticket online and wait for the company to arrange a pickup. It's been 20 days and nobody is in site to pick it up. No physical service center either that you could drop it in. At the end of day, you end up using it while it works and throw it when it stops working."
1479,3.0,"Best in ear Bluetooth earphones you cam get in this price range. I bought it for 1300 and its been 3 months and it is working very fine, specially best while working or while morning run. Battery is also good almost runs whole day in mid volume.

But there is a problem , after 5 mnths suddenly the left side stopped working and got ut replaced as it was under warranty but the new product that i got also stopped working after 2 mnths .. Not pretty reliable."
1480,5.0,"Gifted this to my fiancee. A good option for gifting your man who is sasta, majboot, tikaau and likes to listen to songs in full blast. This good experience may however be backed by him shouting out misheard lyrics out in public, but that's his default setting which is amplified by a good product."
1481,5.0,"I'm not used to write reviews but I'm writing this review specially for it's battery life even though I hardly charge it for 10-15mins it works for 3-4 hours and if I charge it to the full it I can use them whole day.
Sound quality is awesome.
Just a issue is it has very long length it must be reduced at least by 25%.
Or else it's worth a buy product."
1482,1.0,"The first time I purchased it, the charging cable and manual was not there. I got it replaced, just today I got my replacement. The charging cable is still not there. Even after mentioning the details while replacing product, I guess no one has reviewed the comments and got the replacement done.
At least a customer deserves genuine product. I needed to gift this to someone."
1483,3.0,Overall its a good headset.. but it have some major drawbacks.. as a music lover i felt that the bass is good enough but the other things are a bit low. and while playing pubg and using voice chat it automatically reduces the surrounding sounds and i can't hear footsteps and gunshots clearly.. so i think these two are a major problem.
1484,3.0,"This is neither good nor bad type product. Ok ok kind of bluetooth headset.

Sound: Good
Bluetooth: poor
Battery: Good backup but battery level indicator is poor. It's shows 80% but goes shutdown all of the suden."
1485,1.0,"Bluetooth connectivity is really bad. It losts connection so many times even when i am holding my phone in my hand which is connected to this device..... Some times songs r lagging because of the connection problem and it cuts few seconds of the lyrics while playing a song because of the connectivity problem...
Sound quality is likeable if you are a bass lovers....
Noise cancellation is not that good....."
1486,1.0,"I had been using this device around 3 months..it was nice in first experience..but slowly it started disconnecting automatically..so I applied for a replacement.. they replaced me the better one in look only...My problem is it is disconnecting frequently automatically..Bluetooth is a major problem I think...So, My request is to buy any wired earphone than wireless....because, it is costly but has no performance quality..."
1487,5.0,"This product's sound quality is impressive. The tagline speaks for itself - immersive stereo sound is truly what one gets. It charges quickly, and lasts for a long time (5 - 6 hours of use). I also own an Audio Technica M50x, but now it rarely sees use due to these quite marvellous earphones. Note that these headphones costed north of ₹9,000, while these earphones were a fraction of that price. Good job, boAt."
1488,3.0,"I expected more from it. Sound is not so clear at high volume. Noise cancellation while listening to music in public was like so poor, totally zero. I liked my samsung wired earphones better than this with its sound quality and noise cancellation way better."
1489,1.0,"This item which I bought is a defected piece. It works well for me for the first one week later it's not working as expected. Even as per the product description the product is not giving that much charging also. So It's a dummy piece. I didn't expect this kind of worst product from the AMAZON. AS PER MY CONCERN NOW I DON""T DRUST AMAZON any more."
1490,2.0,The product which I got is a low quality product I fu as it's been used and they give away it in sale as. If I use it for 2 hrs continuesly the battery drains off after charging it full. I guess this needs to be corrected. And the name on the hearphones has started coming out. Using it from 5 days. Shame on you boat. If possible I would like to give it back and get it refunded.
1491,5.0,"Sounds quality is very nice...it has a good bass and the build quality is also nice considering it's price but the range of connection is very poor... Even if it is very close to the device the music gets cut a little which is annoying sometimes
Edit: I exchanged the one I received with a new boat rockerz 255 and this one has no issues. The one I received earlier was defective...Changed my rating from 3 stars to 5 stars😃😃"
1492,3.0,"Working fine. Individual has to adjust its rubber fins as per their comfort. Batery backup is not as per expectations. When fully charged, its will show 100%, later on it will show 80% but after some more use it directly surrenders for low battery"
1493,1.0,I have purchased this Product but 1 side sound is not work properly and after 1 month 1 side sound is totally off and I am also compliant Regarding this and generate the complaint I'd but company not resolve my issue.... so I really disappoint to this Product
1494,1.0,"Product is good but got disconnected after some time use.
Requested amazon for Replacement but they did not.
Worst service by amazon for replacement."
1495,1.0,"Don't buy.
In less than 2 months, the battery has given up. It doeebt work if not wired to the charger.

While it says longer usage battery, use time is only 2 hours. Which is not sufficient for office or personal use.

Very poor product and i am unable to claim warranty"
1496,4.0,Battery life is ok only 60 to 70 percentage.. within two days to three days it's getting drain.. but anyway charging time is not too much.. just in a hour or less than a hour it gets charged.. sound quality is awesome.. wireless option is so free feeling when compared with wired headset.. thanks
1497,1.0,"one of the worst product I had never used don't buy this product it's a scrap product from boat and I'm fully upset about this product this is an replacement one again I was facing same problem and the first earphones which I received got damage which connects and disconnects automatically for every 5-10 seconds..
So I kept replacement again I was facing with same problem which connects and disconnects automatically"
1498,3.0,Instant of spending 11k for airpots....i buy this one.....at this price it's look good.....lack of bass....last for 4-5 hr......for me at this price u can't get better than this
1499,2.0,"Not so comfort, not recommend it for jogging / gym. Falls off from ears if you jump or work out in different positions.

Sound quality is average not much to boast about, noise cancellation comes in when volume raised to Max. can't feel all the beats, if there is even a bit of disturbance around."
1500,4.0,Its a very good product for bluetooth.the only thing is the bass is not as same as of boat wired headphones.i had actually used wired ones and i fell in love with bass and then i bought this one expecting the same quality but comparatively its less . Overall the product is good
1501,1.0,I bought this product a few months back. It stopped working. To find out how to claim warranty it took me a week cuz there is only 5 to 8 service center they have throughout the country and when I finally found it out then they took the product now it is been more than 20 days no reply from them. I have been trying to reach their customer care number which always says we are not working today.
1502,2.0,"I will not recommend this product. It has very poor battery life. When on call, voice keeps breaking & sometimes gives strange noise. Bluetooth range is also poor.
It has been 2 months since i am using this product & it has started to show its true colors, even when it's charged it keeps disconnecting from my phone.
Not at all satisfied.
I would suggest to go for a better brand."
1503,4.0,"It's worth of the price, everything is good. But i am having issue when i connect these to my MI 55 Inch tv, automatically wifi disconnecting everytime. When i am not using earphone with tv it works fine. I think there is a comatibility issue"
1504,1.0,Extremely poor battery. Doesn't even last a day on full charge. Practically useless headphones. Sound quality is meh!
1505,5.0,"Amazing bass at that price range. Play with equalizer and you can milk the most out of this earphones. However, one small drawback with this earphones is that when the earbuds is inserted firmly, it tends to kind of air lock the ear which is necessary for Noise cancellation but not so good for your ears."
1506,5.0,"This is one of the earphones with best output within budget.
All the audio aspects are perfect. Bluetooth connection is very good. We can connect to mobile phone and laptop simultaneously without any issue."
1507,5.0,Its great product i purchased it during Diwali Sale n Got it only 699 it was awesome
1508,4.0,"I got it yesterday,used it for mrng walk,quality is good,very comfortable to wear,call quality is good but not great,Base and vocals are clean and neat,noise cancellation is good enough,but what i found was there is lot of disturbance and noise while playing music online,sometimes i felt like it is getting disconnected for a fractiin of second, then playing again,thats d only thing i found in cons, but overall a very good buy in the price range."
1509,5.0,"Very nice product
I had try many companies headphone,but this ""bolt"" enamoured me over all of them,it is fabulous product go for it without any confusion
Be cautious about the price because I had purchased it in dewali relatively lower price than any other day"
1510,5.0,"Awesome !!!Go for it
The angle of ear tip makes extremely comfortable and with best noise and the secondary holder on top cancels every external noise and makes it perfect for sports.I’ve used it for Gyming,badminton,table tennis and for movies and web series.
And Working of Siri is superb and does every task I have given to Siri through earphone."
1511,3.0,"I have been using it for past few days, sound quality and call quality is good. Sound is highly emphasized on base, so base lovers will love it. The only problem I give 3 stars is that there is a connectivity issue. When we play some videos or music the audio comes out from the speaker even though the earphones are connected to it. That's the biggest flaw. Otherwise it's a great product at this price point."
1512,4.0,This boat rockrez 255 wireless Bluetooth headset bought from Amazon but it doesn't work with two device at a time when connecting a laptop it rejecte mobile when connecting mobile it doesn't support laptop this is very bad and aslo when a incoming call receive ringtone sound coming out from the phone not from boat rockrez it's taking to much irrigation when hearing from the boat rockrez ear paining few minutes other wise not bad at all
1513,4.0,Sound is not balanced its heavy on the bassier side.. if you already had an expensive earphones like that of sennheiser's then go for this one only when you're looking for more bass because highs are not that well defined you'll need an equalizer to adjust. Overall for a basshead like me it's good.. battery backup is also great.. build quality is ok type. For 999 it's steal.
1514,2.0,"Pros:
Easy to use
Good quality material used

Cons

Noise Cancellation is very poor. The person on the other side of the call will hear person speaking next to you in a public place, rather than you. I'm extremely upset with this and hence would like to return it.

Ps: Doesnt make sense to save few bucks and buy a sub standard product, instead opt for some other brand"
1515,2.0,"Just good, always facing problem while connecting to other devices like laptop or other phones of Bluetooth version 4.2
Too long wire, not much comfortable.
Battery percentage of earphone also showing wrong in phone. It shuts without notification of low battery in phone.
Notification language for power on, power off or battery low is also not clear in earphone. DISAPPOINTING"
1516,1.0,"I am writing the product review after i got replaced. This product sound quality, bass is nice
But its range is worst. Sometimes it gets disconnected from device, its battery performance is pathetic. I strongly reccomend not to buy this product."
1517,1.0," I ordered 3 but none of them were working properly, one is not charging, other one is not connecting and 3rd one is also not working. And now since return window is closed, I'm not even able to return it. It was a gift to freind and this product put me in very embarrassing situation before friends."
1518,2.0,"The product quality & Sound quality is good. but it stopped working after 5 days of usage, Bluetooth is not working properly, its getting disturbance while listening to the music. if you keep phone in pocket its gets disconnected.

I've dropped complaint and returned my product. its almost 15 days completed no response from BoAt. worst experience."
1519,1.0,"I am really surprised how can people can suggest this product. The sound quality is so poor that you can't even listen a song. The sounds quality matches with old music system with no bass and vocal clarity. There is absolutely no bass and sounds like I am in sitting in auto and listening to the music played in the same.

I can't be priced more than 200-300. A third grade product."
1520,4.0,"I am really contented with the headphones, really good sound quality, noise cancellation and bass. Use it for my workouts and it doesn't feel uncomfortable to use while sweating out badly. Battery life is a minor issue. I use it for about 4-5 hours a day and I have to charge it maximum after a day and a half and sometimes after a single day also. A little dissatisfied with the battery life."
1521,3.0,Overall its a good deal in the price given. I think the noise cancellation could have been better.Also if you use continuously battery doesn't last more than 4 hours. At times it becomes irritating as despite having headphones you wait until you go back and charge it. Did not help in long travelling hours. Keep a wired headphones with you if don't want to be bored when the battery goes off.
1522,4.0,"NOT BAD.

BEST BLUETOOTH EARPHONES IN THIS PRICE SEGMENT.

NOISE CALCELLATION IS EFFECTIVE TO A EXTENT

SOUND QUALITY IS GREAT.

BATTERY LIFE IS AWSOME. LAST UPTO 6HRS IN NORMAL DAILY USAGE.

WHAT I EXPECT IS A COLLAR CLIP AT THE BACK SO THAT WHEN YOU ARE ON BIKE WEARING A T SHIRT IT WIIL NOT SLIP OF FROM NECK.

BAKI TO SAB THIK HAI."
1523,5.0,"Purchased in the month of Dec and it is still good
1. Sound quality is awesome
2. This s treat for music lovers.
3. If u r driving also, you can wear this headset, no distortions, clear music...
4. Long lasting Battery life
5. U can attend calls, call to the recently dialled in numbers and if you have enabled, unlock Google assistant features from mobile, you can directly call to contacts"
1524,5.0,"I was Totally confused since youtube reviews says that it has overpowering bass. But its just right amount..
Mids and lows are decent to just keep the volum at 50 to 60% and everything works like a charm..
Overall satisfied with this purchase..👌"
1525,1.0,"Overall product is good, but one earpiece is having no sound now, this is the main problem, not expected from boat such quality problem. Please change the headphones and give me another one as there is product issue within 2 months"
1526,2.0,"Though the sound quality of earphones is really good initially. One of the buds stopped functioning after 12 days depriving me of even a replacement. Though my key strokes could be heard, music couldnt be played in one of the earplugs. They are very handy and comfortable in design too. But a reapir within no time is disappointing."
1527,3.0,"when we call some one so bluetooth is stable connected but whenever we recevd call from another person the connectivity is auto setup over phone bluetooth is disable automaticlly, so we had to setup manually fucntion. not good for bikers, and car drivers."
1528,4.0,"Pros:-
1. Sound quality exellent.
2. Battery backup good 7 to 8 hours but it's intial days.
3. stylish and light to wear on neck.
4. I got it at 999 rs only
Cons:-
1. previous and next buttons are missing, which are even available in Chinese scraps
2. Mic not working good, have to speak louder or repeat."
1529,4.0,"sound quality: heavy bass, the vocals and instrumentals are a little drowned out by this. But I prefer heavy bass for workouts.
build: build is pretty good and flexible. it has a frame which goes around the neck, this can be kind of annoying when running or jumping, but i just tuck it underneath my shirt. the eartips havent fallen out yet, they are a great fit.
function: just a reminder that to change tracks u have to hold down volume up and down keys, double tapping middle button actually calls the previous person you called."
1530,3.0,"Adding review after 4 months after I brought it. Headphone is good for music listener also good connectivity, good to buy at this range. No much of issue if you dont bother abt noise cancellation. There is no noise cancellation, during call person at the other side hear other background voice than our voice. There is no noise cancellation during call recording there is so much disturbance."
1531,1.0,It has been few weeks since I purchased and the left side ear phone has completely stopped working. Not expected for a product worth ₹1500. It has now become useless for me. Don't know what to do.
1532,5.0,"Bluetooth connectivity 5 out 5
SOUNDS quality;
Vocals 4 out 5
Bass 5 out 5
Instruments sounds 5 out 5
Battery;
Battery stand by time awesome more than 1 week
Battery Performance 5 hr to 8hr
Charging time 2hr
Build quality is excellent and waterproof
Worth of buying product 4.5 out 5"
1533,3.0,It is not boat rockerz 255 because during connectivity it is connected by boat rockerz only. After connecting I heard you are connected with boat rockerz only...not boat rockerz 255. 255 not heard by boat bluetooth.
1534,3.0,"Too much bass but treble and mids lost.
If yo want to listen all drum beats go for it if you want to listen little loader bass with all blues. Don't go for that."
1535,4.0,"BoAt rockers is excellent audio headset at this price. Fortunately I purchased this on offer @899/-.
Bluetooth connectivity upto 5-6 mtr works good.
Battery backup is also excellent as per specification."
1536,4.0,"I have purchased four of these. Good connectivity, good battery life and superb call quality. Souch quality is okay. If your requirement is mostly calls and sometimes songs/movies. Its perfect."
1537,5.0,Used another devise but this one is realky fast charged...good sound quality..noice control more or less ok and easy to carry anywhere i want...in any bag or keep it on my neck for the whole day.
1538,4.0,"As I get these for jus Rs. 999, the sound quality is great for me in this price range with wireless connectivity.
It gives me more then 6 hours of battery backup on every full charge ( got discharged in between 6-7.5 hours depending on my usage).
I m happy that I bought it. 😊"
1539,2.0,This product comes with best in class sound quality. The bass that it delivers is just prefect. But on the other side the product does not lasts long. The one I purchased had a problem in the left earphone in 10 months. Good thing it was in warranty of one year. But what if it happened in the 13th month. 🤞🤞 It's good but is often interrogated on durability. Choose wisely.
1540,1.0,"Seriously I m disappointed... I gifted tht to my bf.. That's d worst part.. 😭😔After the use of 1 month, even I can't return or replace.. Slowly I bcz worst... No nose cancellation and I can't hear anything clearly even I m alone in d home.. Sucks alotttttttt.."
1541,1.0,"The quality of the product is very bad.
2 months later after buying the product one if speaker stopped functioning.
Bluetooth connectivity is also poor while you are riding your bike.
Please don't buy this product instead prefer the mivi ones they are far away better.
boAt ven won't clear your Warranty even if it is warranty period.
Buy mivi thunderbeats which I am using currently."
1542,5.0,"At this price range best Bluetooth earphones I m very confusing between mi sport, boat 261 n boult curve bt I m finally choose boat sport 255 at amazing deal offer at RS only 999@ and the packing also good n baas quality is awesome depend on your music player sound quality superb and battery back up also good 6 hours minimum depending on your use I m giving my rating for this Bluetooth earphones 5 out 4.8"
1543,4.0,"Everything is good , the only cons is the range... Although it gives a good range of about 10 meters but a single wall will break it's sound even if one is 2 meter away.

Sound is great ( good bass )
Qualcomm chipset in 999 what else you need..
Sweat water resistant ( didn't tried it yet )
Boat brand...
And mic quality is very good but not excellent
Bought it for INR 999."
1544,4.0,"For the price these are good, the sound quality is decent, not awesome noise cancellation, but at this price this is one of the best in Bluetooth. The battery life even after using it for 3 months is very good, i keep them on the whole day and recharge them at night."
1545,4.0,"With in a week this what happened the plastic started peeal off and the BT stranth also weeaken up getting click and glitch sound and auto disconnect and reconnect

Has no option

Need to use or visit service center

Dear team share the service center number and near by address"
1546,1.0,"Not Worth its Price of Rs.1,499/- when I bought it in November 2018.
From last month it is constantly Malfunctioning,
Sometimes one side does not work, sometimes when it moves a little Distorting Sound from other side,
Battery also has gone done from full day to 2 hours maximum.
So, its not worth the Premium Price paid."
1547,3.0,"I think the product is cool, but i need to suggest you people that while driving i cant hear proper voice and also the opposite person have trouble for the voice....so i dnt like that apart from it its a good product by boat"
1548,5.0,"Decent bass (when ear pods are properly positioned / seated, as is the case with any in-ear headphones), good bluetooth connectivity, affordable price. Been using for about 2 months now, and all is well."
1549,4.0,"It is good earphone , that gives you good quality sound, bass and notice cancelation.
I got it in 899 and I think it is worth buying.
Range is not too much, not longer than 10m. I have dought
about its battary back up.
Now you can buy from other sides too at same cost."
1550,4.0,"Nice product from boAt
Pros : sound quality, battery life, easy to use and carry, fast connectivity to ur devices.
Cons : after using for an hour or more it pains in ur ear,so u need to take it off for some time .
Conclusion: value for money
boAt needs to look into this issue.

U may go for it 👍🏻"
1551,5.0,After 7 months of use i am happy with the headset. but when the right side ear piece was not working i have raised a complaint to boat site and they have replace the entire headset. It takes 3 weeks for the process. But they have replaced the entire product.
1552,4.0,"Yes you can buy this Made for Bass. Clarity is good. Bluetooth connection is good,Volume is good, fitting is also good,light weight,comfy,easy 2 days battery life on a single charge"
1553,4.0,"Sound quality is a strict meh; there's loads of bass but it's the boomy bad quality bass. There also seems to be some static from Bluetooth at times. But serves just about all of my purpose for 999rs. And yes, battery life is fantastic."
1554,3.0,The one Side of earphones doesn't work and it's very bad please help me out with replacement
1555,4.0,"After using this for more than one month, it can be said that, the product is simply fabulous. But battery downs rapidly after use, sometimes from 80% to 20%. Though it lasts for sufficient times. I got it for 999/- , so for me it is perfect in this price range."
1556,2.0,You can use atleast for three months.. which will follows by damage of one side ear piece usually the right side which happens in two of what I bought and another of my friend. Battery no doubt it's great. Can't connect to two mobiles or devices.
1557,5.0,One of the best product I have used so fart at this range what is providing a very quality and this product is just it's fantastic fantabulously fantastic..... Must bye
1558,3.0,"Build quality, Connectivity range and most of all batter backup is very poor. Returned it and bought realme ear buds for 500 more but 12hrs backup and better build design."
1559,4.0,"Sound quality is good for loud bass lovers.

Good for listening to music

But not good for attending calls, the voice through microphone is very low, the person you are speaking with will get to hear a very low voice.

Battery Backup is good

Look wise its okay"
1560,5.0,"I got this earphone for 949 RS. It is worth for price. Sound quality is very good and bass is also very much high. And design and color is also very attractive. it is little bit uncomfortable for running. Because of very long size its bounced while running.
Good for gym and crossfit workout. You can buy upto 1299 RS."
1561,4.0,Value for money. I got it for 1.5k the sound quality is decent...with mid level bass and treble...good for playing games...answering calls...and occasional music..but the Bluetooth range gets affected if we move away more than 8-9 feet.
1562,5.0,"The bass and treble is well balanced and is very good in comfort using since 1 yr no problem faced yet but the little problem is that battery is not much long lasting it may last 3_5 hrs barely , and voice clearity is awesome and the band has soft touch must use product"
1563,4.0,Enjoying the device since once month. Ear buds can be of better quality. While inserting make noise. Blue tooth connectivity voice messages are irritating and are lengthy.
1564,3.0,"I m heaving issue while talking to the phone sometimes Other person cant hear u properly .i have claim a warranty in which product has reached today 2 nd octomber and dispatch at 25 th september i dnt know wat boat service is doing.i m waiting for the product hopefully .
Please dont buy it untill you live where near by boat service centre is available ."
1565,4.0,"I personally was sceptical about buying a Bluetooth earphone within this range and style. But they turned out to be fine. They have great connectivity and works fine when attending a call. Noise can be improved a little bit but at this range, the noise performance, feel of the product, style and small things such as earplug magnets are a great experience all together."
1566,1.0,"Battery life sucks 😑.
Works only for 1.30 hours after full charge
Update:
Even after full charge works for only 15 mins
Send product for exchange and it has been more than 20 days. But didn't get any reply from boats team.
Worst service they don't reply to emails or phone calls.
This is my ticket no.519897
Hate it never buying boat products 😡"
1567,5.0,"Excellent product with good sound quality, voice quality, call is clear with air noise cancellation while driving. Blue tooth connectivity is flawless. Easy to use."
1568,1.0,"Writing a review after using for 2 weeks, pl don't buy this for voice calls. Not good at all. Huge background noise. It is not noise cancelling, it's a noise amplifying headphone.

Took for calls, the other party cannot listen to your voice , only the background sounds are audible. Big regret. Worst sound quality."
1569,1.0,I am writing this after 7 month approximately ( bought on may 7 2019 and writing reviews on 1st December 2019).... And Sad to tell that one side is not working... This is really bad... Though the headset are good ... These are only for 6 months... Only buy this product if you are ok for 6 months... Not recommended for long term purpose... Please do not buy if you use it extremely...
1570,1.0,Worst product and especially worst service from Boat company .....The product is not working properly and after claiming the warranty boat has send another cheap quality internally damaged headphones
1571,2.0,"Used it for hardly 5 months during my workout session, it stopped working suddenly with a real paining sound, they clearly mentioned that it is meant for intense workout, but it is actually not even sweat resistant which leads to the internal short circuit, not even the led is not glowing."
1572,3.0,"Got this product at 999 in sale
Pros.
1) neon colour is very good
2) u can charge this once every two days.
3) sound is good, bass is more punched.
Cons.
1) the product box was damaged so replaced it.
2) packaging was not good, Amazon disappointed me this time.
3) if u have a high end phone than Bluetooth connectivity is good or else it may lag or latency will be there."
1573,4.0,"Sound quality and Bass is good ..but i will rate it 8/10 in battery because battery drains out too quickly ,its like
100% to 80%- in 1½ hours
80%to 60%-in 1 hour
60%to 40% -in 30 min
40% to 20% -in 15min
20% to zero- in 2min

Bluetooth connectivity- Quite good 8/10
Looks-9/10
Call quality-7/10 Not too clear
Bass-10/10
Comfort-9/10
Overall-8/10"
1574,5.0,"The product as a buyer i am fully satisfied .. and if u ask me whether to take or not i will say go for it .. at this price i can say its the best you can get ..

the sound quality is quite good .. Bluetooth connectivity is best part of it you can hear around whole house so you don't need to take phone while you're in home .. and noise cancellation is moderate .. overall excellent product"
1575,5.0,Beat BT earphones go for it best sound and best noise cancellation. Good for students and music wow. Great battery life upto 7 hrs with 75% volume. Good remote control can take calls and and change the tracks. Good for calling also. Good mic I love it.
1576,2.0,"I bought the Boat Rockerzz 255R some 20 days ago and it was going all fine for about 15 days. After that one of the sides started to give broken sounds and gradually in the next few days, it was started getting more and more broken and stopped working."
1577,5.0,"Bought it at ₹999 during sale.
Probably the best at its price, boAt never upsets you with their product.
After full charge continuous music can be played for 7-7.5 hours.
Been 4months and no issues, just a great product.

Edit :
Been more than a year now, and still works great. Probably the coolest bluetooth earphone at this price range !"
1578,2.0,"Ok guys
Sound is 3 out of 5 only bass no serious good sound
Sound is not very high for pubg
The biggest problem is that i ise iphone and it beeps very much while increasing or decreasing volume, changing song playing paise even while dragging it , it feels very bad and it is very annoying . My honest advice is that it should’ve been not priced for more than 1000 rupees"
1579,1.0,"Stopped working 4th time in 10 months now. 3 times i have sent it for replacement. Takes an average 20 days to come back after replacement by boat. And now boat has discontinued pickup and replace from doorstep service for this model, so inspite of the product being in warranty period i cannot use the service . If u want a product that will last a maximum 3 months then do go for it ."
1580,5.0,amazing quality.pure bass and maintain sound. noice cancelation.battery backup is osm.and main thing in this product is dual connectivity. its bluetooth 4.0 connectivity i give 10/10.
1581,4.0,"Excellent headphones for sound.

Major hindrance in multitasking ( hence reducing 2 stars )
It's connection interferes with other Bluetooth or WiFi connection or casting causing problems."
1582,2.0,"Firstly j love boat products, I have many boat devices at my home and all are good service is good.
But this is not a value for money device
They can't be adjust in ears properly by changing buds also
Connectivity of this device is worst"
1583,4.0,Yup I like this. But packet was damaged or maybe someone open the packet. I want to make a review and unblocking video for my YouTube channel. For my pointer view this was not good. (Packet damaged or open)
1584,4.0,"Overall product is good.
But DON'T BUY if you're using wifi as primary source for internet connectivity,as it hinders Bluetooth connectivity while taking WhatsApp calls.i checked the issue on 3 different phones(OnePlus 6t, iPhone 7,op 3t).i have returned product twice but the problem didn't resolve.But on the other side,when your cell phone is connected to your sim card internet connectivity,it works well."
1585,2.0,"The bluetooth connection is not very stable. The sound quality is below par with no noise cancellation at all. I understand that at this price tag, you can't expect much, but the least you expect from an earphone is a good sound quality."
1586,3.0,"Sound quality is good
Noise cancellation should be improved little more
Bluetooth connectivity is good bt some times it cracks the music rhythm

Still Same i would say, Now a days the bluetooth is getting Disconnecting again and again in certain Frequency
and the Grip of Ear rubbers should be firm - It slips down quickly"
1587,1.0,"Actually all are good but the product after two three months one side was not working that is the main issue. I claim my warranty they send new product but again two three months got same problem(one side not working)
i replaced three times after warranty i don't know how to claim, so what iam telling i think all products have same issue so i'm telling u don't buy this product."
1588,3.0,"I'm not too much of an audiophile but I do look for proper instrument separation, clear vocals and a good bass.

The bass is really overpowering. If you're into that, then great but I honestly hate it for that.

However, battery life is great! And seems pretty durable. Fitting is good, with 3 bud size options. Pairs easily."
1589,3.0,the sound quality and noise cancellation are good but right earpiece stopped working after 6 months. the product is still under warranty but unable to claim it because they have removed the product from their support site. so better buy this with less life expectancy.
1590,3.0,"High bass, low mids and trebble is not that gr8, overall I am not satisfied with the product quality.

My samaung wired earphones worth 450/- produce much balance sound & way better than Boat rocker 255"
1591,5.0,"Boat is very nice product in This budget..! Amazing Sound clarity . Also 10hours of Playing and 150 hours standby charge. With 110mah..
Bass 10/10
Vocal-Treble9/10
Battery 10/10 ..
I prefer black because of rich look..
And Volume and Track keys... Nice.. Great Boat team.. I got for 899 in offer Thanks Amazon.."
1592,2.0,"Used few days and found that sometimes device is disconnecting very frequently or every minute. Range is another issue, can't cross another wall. Sound quality is not up to mark due to bass I think."
1593,3.0,"Okiesh pro duct at price of 1k.
Major problem is its sound quality is too much terrific. Bass is boosted with use of software configuration which reduces the quality of sound. Only usable for calling . If you are music lover you can't hear for more than 1-2 songs .

Amazon return service is best.returned product in 2 days.
Buy Mivi thunder bits instead .. it have better quality..."
1594,1.0,"We had booked 3 pieces of boat Bluetooth devices 2 red and 1 black. Box which had black device was damaged and bar code label wasn't found. But found those in the red devices. We worried about whether the black was original or not. We have opted for the replacement and kindly replace with the new black one,if not we are ready to approach Consumer Court. Please replace the product as soon as possible."
1595,1.0,I just bought this earphone 4 months back.One side of my earphone is not working now.I have already registered a complaint about this so many times in boat Service team but it was not resolved still now. The service is worst in boat. So please don't buy it.They told me they replace the product within 2 weeks but they didn't do anything. Don't Prefer this Boat at all...Very worst one I have ever seen.
1596,3.0,"Sounds good for the price range.
Only disappointment is very poor range, cuts of within 3m.
Think before you buy."
1597,4.0,"This is one of those Bluetooth earphones whose bass i liked. I have tried boult audio, jbl earphones but in this price range, boat beats both of them.
The sound quality is awesome, treble is also good. Bass is also good but i expected better bass, but as i said it's worth the price. Of the few other brands price of which are <=2000, this beats them all in every aspect. Built quality is premium."
1598,3.0,"The build quality is not the best you can find.
Audio is quite good but I often face audio stuttering issues. The mic is bad.
Summary:
Audio quality : 3/5
Mic : 2/5
Bluetooth connectivity : 2/5
Noise cancelation : 3/5
The problem I am facing might be limited to this particular piece . I have requested for a return."
1599,5.0,"excellent product. full paisa vasool. really good sound quality, fits the ear well, is light in weight. bluetooth connectivity is excellent. very happy with the product"
1600,5.0,"Extradinary service by the BOAT company
I have been using this for an year now.
I claimed warranty 2 times and they provided me good service.
My friend bought BOLT and it's service is so poor he was not satisfied
Every object will gain defect one or the other day service makes difference
You can claim warrent if it has some problems but it should not be damaged Physically"
1601,4.0,"Sound quality is really good and initially, battery backup counts for 5-6 hrs.. fits well in ear but noice cancellation is just ok ok type..overall it's a must buy purchase at BBD price of 899/-"
1602,4.0,"Reviewing the product after several months of use.
Amazing set of earphones in this price range. Gives you 100% noise cancelation with powerful base and long lasting battery backup (lasts upto 8hrs of continuous usage).
Great option for music lovers.
Not worth for calling purposes, as the background noise is more than your own voise to the caller on the other side, It's very annoying."
1603,5.0,"Value for money, noise cancellation that you can expect from an earphone, awesome audio quality, weigh less, good bluetooth connectivity, trendy and stylish. Battery charging is good and lasts promised amount of time."
1604,5.0,"- good battery backup with minimum of 10 hrs
- for boat bass is really good
- value for money
- best in sound class

No CONS as such but for charging it takes around 1hrs 30min"
1605,3.0,"I have just bought it and hardly used it 3 times...
Now these has started to give a ""hissing"" sound after connecting it to my device...
And main thing is it is not connecting itself to my PC I have tried a lot..but these are not good..
Such a bad thing by amazon India ...
I have never expected this thing from amazon...
Please don't buy these stufs from amazon....
So bad...😔😭"
1606,3.0,"Sound quality is not good as i was expecting.
Overall good product but connectivity as also can be improved, I'll suggest you to buy if you're going to use it withing 5-6 meter area. Good for calling and all.

Overall good you can purchase if you want and you don't like the product like me you can return it within 15 days..!

Thank You...!"
1607,3.0,I had to struggle with this device...recently bought it for my one plus 7T handset...the quality and the make of the device is average with not very soothing sound output. I got it replaced but the replaced device was a 2nd hand product given to me as a replacement from Amazon. Got surprised and upset with the customer service approach from Amazon.
1608,4.0,"Sound not good i have been using cx180 and bassheads 225 recently u cant compare them with this,still noise cancellation is cool,(do not wear while travelling).
Battery gives 10+ hrs continue usage,
For me the earbuds hurt a bit after using of long hours.
Overall still a good deal."
1609,5.0,"Good product so far. got this product yesterday. I have given a 5 star rating on this, but there are somd demerits also.

1. Length is the main disadvantage of this product. It seems odd..
2. The size of ear buds might be a major problem. It might be painfull in future...

Update when i find more problems..."
1610,2.0,It's difficult to use this for a phone call if standing in a noisy place. The headphone picks up all the noise from the surroundings and the recepient of the phone call is unable to hear anything you say.
1611,5.0,"Writing review after 9 months of usage. dont buy these headset go for mi sport. these are getting problema very frequently. one side not working. But i like the boat service. they are replacing the product. and one more annoying thing is it will take about 20-25 days to replace product. my head set got dameged for 2 times and replaced it. too bad quality. coming to sound quality,base, and battery its unbeatable for any other company."
1612,1.0,"Sound quality is great, everything is fine... The only problem is the durability.... It struggles to last more than 2 months, its nt only with me.... I have 3 of my frnds having the same issue... Adding on top of it, the warranty and replacement is a time gulping process... I have been following up with the team just to get an uodate on my ticket,. Beware of it.."
1613,2.0,"If you ask about sound part. Just Awesome! Bass and vocals both on point and clear. Simple and classy look. If you talk about connectivity , it SUCKS !! Every time there is some distortion due to connectivity and keep getting disconnected. There is some issue with battery also. One time it will show 100% then 80% then off... Sometimes it comes till 60% then off.."
1614,1.0,"it will work fine only for few days after that . product will stop responding to connect with bluetooth and when you will complain they will say your mobile have the problem and i am using iphone XS ,,
and it is so cheap quality . i think its from chinese worst cheap quality they are selling (beware of Corona)
also see the picture . how worst this is."
1615,4.0,"It connects well and battery durability is also good. after charging for 2-3 hours, it can work upto 5-6 hours straight.
Sound quality and connectivity is also good."
1616,3.0,"The product has decent build quality which makes it durable. However the cable is too long which makes it look a little weird hanging around your ears. Battery drains quickly. Sound is amazing, perhaps the USP of the product. Not good for bike riders as wearing a helmet gives pain in the ears."
1617,4.0,"Got this for 999 during a sale. Comparatively a better product at this price segment. Lasts more than 6 hours. The build quality is good. Can pair devices at once (you cannot listen to both,but you can swap when you get a call). Worth the price.... 👍"
1618,4.0,"Nice product, amazing sound quality, you'll absolutely love them if you are a bass lover, easy to use, rigid fit so you'll be perfectly fine while your running or exercising, and definitely sweat proof. Also the battery is nice but the only reason why I gave it a 4 and not a 5 is because the battery drains way too quickly after it hits a 60% mark."
1619,4.0,Got it during Great Indian Festival sale. It is absolutely value for money. Have been using wired headphones all through...so these provide me real ease of use. Connectivity is good.I don't use them much for calls though but for music it is great. It is best for bass heads. I am not sure of using the same on 2 devices at se.time as have never used this feature. Thanks AZ Prime for promt delivery!!
1620,5.0,"I bought this today, it's sound quality is awesome but bass is not so deep which I expected. In bass out of 10 I give it 7 . But sound quality is too good. Must buy. Not highly recommended for bass lovers.Battery backup is also very good. Durability , ipx technology are also very good. Impressive product from boat. Buy this.🙂👍👍🙂"
1621,4.0,"BoAt Rockerz bluetooth earphones are good 👍
It's battery life is not good,
But it charged fastly than any other it is waireless thats why it more useful, it's performance is brilliant, Attractive ergonomics with a Comfort Fit, With the wireless functionalitysurely your companion for your travel and daily needs,Compatible With: Laptop, Mobile, Tablet."
1622,5.0,Though I didn't buy it in prime day sale I am happy with the product and it's sound quality good bass and clear sound. Nice isolation but battery backup could have been better. Build quality is nice. Overall a nice entry level Bluetooth headphone
1623,1.0,Overall poor product. It didn't charged from day 1. It was as useless for me. Now the company has taken back the product in the name of warranty and is not giving me back my original product. Their so called phone number does not work. So if you are looking for after sales service dont go for it. It's a total harrasmsment. I would give 0/5. Poor service and poor product as well.
1624,1.0,"Please don't buy this earphone.
First I got difective product from Amazon that time right side earphone was not working and I got exchange from Amazon. Then after 3 month automatically right side earphone stopped working then I got exchange from boat service center now again I'm facing same issue right side earphone is not working..
But it has 2 year warranty, I'm going to exchange again.."
1625,5.0,I'm really love it... Bass lovers pls go for it.. Now I'm really a fan of boat headphones... Lite weight.. Battery life is good it's giving continues play back of 6-7 hrs.. Perfect fit... If u guys looking for a Bluetooth headphones under 1500 just go for it... Really worth it..
1626,5.0,"Pros:-
1. Easy to carry on neck feel really comfortable.
2. Connectivity is simple.
3. Bass and sound clarity is awesome.
4. Backup was also overwhelming.
5. Bluilt quality is also good.
Cons:-
1. Connectivity range is little low."
1627,5.0,"The product is quite sturdy, flexible and has great music quality but unfortunately the absence is noise cancellation makes the caller on the other side to listen to more of the background noise and voices than yours."
1628,4.0,"Its pretty decent wireless earpiece at this price range , brought it for 999 rs
1.Sound quality is good at first but now its become avarage ,
2. Bass is good
3. Battery backup is also good at first its runs around 6-7 hours but now 4-5 hours
5. True sweat proofing , even i have used it under heavy rain but its work fine till now
6. Avarege build quality"
1629,1.0,"I am not sure why this product has so high rating as this product is below average quality. While in call, this headphone is not clearly audible and makes noise, disturbance to person on call.
I contacted Amazon 2 weeks ago and even customer rep said voice was distorted, so requested for return as this product as it not working properly. I have not heard anything from this company or amazon"
1630,5.0,"Great battery and good audio quality. I love it. This is goes with me to office, shop, market everywhere.
- Good connectivity.
- Good audio quality of bass and treble.
- Good look
- Great comfort in wearing for several hours.
- Good battery."
1631,5.0,Got the great deal. And quality of products is just out of this world. And also battery back up is nice.
1632,5.0,I'm writing this review after 4hours of usage. I've used 2 boat products boat 225 and boat 900 before buying this one. And boat has impressed me with this one too. Im a basshead so people who like bass can blindy go for it according to me this is the best in the segment. Call quality is average. Battery life is good👍
1633,3.0,"Not an disappointing product, but i expected more after reading previous reviews of this headphone ,

Good sound quality and bass, good battery backup .
But connectivity was not as good , it's randomly disconnecting and connecting.
Bluetooth range could be better."
1634,2.0,"It was amazing product. Base was nice. It last for more than 6 hours.
I didn't get any USB charging cable with the package."
1635,4.0,"Battery life disappoint you it's only 3-4 hours in full sound, sound is very clear and bass is awesome, at the price it's a fabulous product, if you want it for riding then its not for you."
1636,5.0,Good sound Quality product for this price. Battery is good as it comes for 6hrs of usage. My only concern is mic quality is not as expected as more surrounding noise is captured when speaking. Other than this it's money worthy.
1637,3.0,Item is as it is like in picture. The base is high. It is not fitting in years comfortable. It coming out. Sound quality is ok but not too good. It is not pausing on contact of both ends of ear phones.
1638,3.0,"Difficult to use it while driving with helmet...... The earpiece of the headphones are really big, it comes out of the ears... When you use full helmet the headphones gets pressed inside your ears.... When the headphones gets pressed inside you ears the voice will babe very low, it will be very painful while removing it.... Nose cancellation is very less... External nose is more than my voice.."
1639,1.0,"1st we can't keep our phone in even trousers pocket or it will lose bluetooth connectivity..too poor bluetooth connectivity...
2nd instead of having noise cancellation feature its having noise creating features..whenever we talk through this earphone another person will listen all other sounds except your voice..I have experienced it and putting request for return...it's not at all useful."
1640,2.0,"Noise cancellation is zero. Call recipient always complaints that lots of background noise at my end whenever I use this earphones. I am using OnePlus 6t which has best noise cancellation feature.

Today, post 19 days of purchase, charging nt happening, led not turning red or blue, heating up in a minute while charging.

I don't know where to complaint and get this replaced."
1641,1.0,"Post sales support is pathetic, I brought this product on 1st October. Now i am facing the power on problem, this speaker don't power on though i have fully charged. It is switching on while charging. I am trying to submit the support request in Boat's website. while submitting the page says one or the other error and not taking further.

I am totally disappointed with Boat's support."
1642,2.0,"After many research I bought this earphone thinking that it is best Bluetooth earphone at best price. Initially it worked as expected but after two months of normal use, it's earbuds and hooks went off. Then suddenly its left side earpiece stopped working. I used this one with care as mentioned in manual and used for only two hours a day every day and two. Very very disappointed. I guess they compromised the quality to compete with competitors price."
1643,5.0,"This is the best bluetooth earphones I have purchased ever. Best bass, though a crispness in the sound is required but still I like it very much. Bluetooth connectivity is also too quick and stable."
1644,4.0,Good battery life. Bass is kind of overpowering. The earplugs that come with it was too uncomfortable for me. Maybe fir others it would fit better. Overall I would rate it 7/10.
1645,5.0,"Best headphone for this price range mids, bass and treble are at good tuning. Bass is a bit Punching which is nice for bass heads. There is no big lag in time but found a little lag in gaming audio. Neckband is extremely light weight can't feel it like wearing and flexible too."
1646,4.0,"It's a good one! But don't expect much from this! It's a basic Bluetooth earphones! It has volume buttons and a central button! You can only increase/decrease volume, lift calls, use Google assistant and switch on/off the East phones that's it!
I expected much more advanced control system and features than this!"
1647,4.0,"I ordered this earphone which i received was good, I ordered one more for my friend, that one packaging was worst earphone also damaged. I replaced same one again package was very bad and not safe, light scratches on the product. Its really a good and worth earphone, send it with good package."
1648,4.0,Sound is awsm. but the buds runs away slowly slowly from your ears adjusting them again and again. cant wear them inside a helmet and if you keep the phone in your pants pocket then comes the connectivity issue. mic should be little more powerful.
1649,5.0,"Value for money product. Before purchasing this item, I used to think that Bluetooth earphones are not good. But this earphone change my mind. The design and sound quality of this headset is awesome. And battery life is also good. If you need such device, then go for it. I purchased it for ₹1400, but can get it at 1000 in Sale."
1650,5.0,Wanna tell u when I bought it for first time. It was the best then any of the headset I have ever used. And after that I ordered two more. But they where the fake or was not that good. Sound was too bad and the Bluetooth chip set was different from the first I ordered. I can say they where not original. So I replaced them and again I got the fake one so I finally returned them.
1651,4.0,"Sound quality-Good
Battery life-Good,gvs 5-6hrs back up
Battery left percentage doesn't works well,at the 5th-6th hours when battery is totally about to drain, percentage indicator still shows at 40%"
1652,1.0,"The product is not worth buying as per the price. Their are many other brand products available in the market with better sound quality and and that with a lesser price. The sound quality is also not good. Theirs a defect for the Bluetooth range. The only pro that I found was the battery life, which lasts approx 5-6 hours after full charge on continuous play."
1653,2.0,"Liked it, but not up to the mark, while you are on call, the other guy will hear lots of noise, which will in turn make you to connect to the phone again instead of boat device."
1654,2.0,"Can Amazon help me in replacing this product..? Since it was mentioned that this above product has a free ""One Year Replacement""...! From past many days the left speaker is not working..So Kindly if you guys mention such kind of genuine policies kindly get back to my genuine issue regarding the same Boat rockers 225"
1655,5.0,"Excellent product with great quality and amazing customer service. After 8months I had technical issue with the product, dropped a complaint to the boat customer service, their response was amazing, they fixed it within a month with free of charge since it's covered under warranty. They didn't even charge for courrier. So far the service and product quality I would give 4.5."
1656,5.0,Good range of Bluetooth connectivity. Clear audible sound. Noise cancellation can be improved. Improve
1657,5.0,"After so much research bought this product.
Satisfied with the battery back up.
Charging speed is also good .
Sound quality is ok not so much loud.
Noise cancellation is satisfactory.
Easy to pair with device."
1658,3.0,"The product starts giving metallic sound after one week. . Too much interference in GSM band where mobile network coverage is not very strong.

I am not able to use regularly this issue."
1659,3.0,"I wasn't able to connect with Me note 4 and Note 8 pro.
After multiple attempts, it connected to Note 4. But it worth the hassle since the box seal was broken before it arrived."
1660,4.0,Damn good value for money and sound quality is excellent. Noice cancellation quality is great. Only thing is the ear plug wire length is bit too long for my liking. Wish they could have shortened the length of the ear plug wire of the neck brace.
1661,1.0,"This product just got disconnected from my phone many times then many times it switched off automatically. Product not up to the mark as described by the seller.
Boat do fix this issue on your headphone boat rockerz 255."
1662,3.0,"Soud Quality is Ok ok
Bluetooth connectivity for single device is good.

Cons -
Connectivity with devices has problem sometimes.
Noise cancellation is worst.
I get robotic like voices when I am close to metal body even though my phone and earphones are just 1 feet away.
Same happens if on call when connected to two devices."
1663,4.0,The main reason I needed this product was for my morning work out. But it’s not at all comfortable while running. Another downside to this was the sound quality which isn’t consistently good
1664,5.0,"Perfect balance of bass and treble at this price range. One of my earbuds did stop working after about 5 months, which was expected with the amount of use that I've gotten out of these, but were easily fixed (if you know where the fixing needs to be) and of course if it's within warranty you're all set."
1665,5.0,"If the usage is excessive don't buy it coz after a certain period, itching starts n feels uncomfortable in your ears, But if u r going to use while driving or just for calls then it's recommended, the sound is crisp n clear mic works perfectly fine in excessive clatter, the battery is also long lasting."
1666,5.0,"Nice headphone and battery backup is arount 6 to 7 hrs
But 1 droback this headphone ... Vibration alert call , msg not available..in this device.. Please improve it"
1667,4.0,"Awesome product
Value for money
Noise cancellation is very bad & while taking calls ambiance noise is too much to the caller."
1668,4.0,This one is the best bluetooth earphones you can get at this price range. However I'm disappointed that it states on website as dual pairing but it does not. Can someone from boat check the same.
1669,2.0,"This earphone is a classic example of discomfort in all the senses. Firstly, the plugs are substantially heavy and also bear a bad design which makes it painful to wear while sleeping on one side. Secondly, like any other cheap earphones, this one also suffers from the common problem of one plug going dumb in a short span of time. The cherry on the top is that it cannot be connected to Ipad."
1670,5.0,Love love loved the headphones... Best buy under the price range! Super strong and compatible... Great Bluetooth range... Gets a bit messed up around metals like iron.. very happy with the quality and fit.. gifted one to my sister as well aftr using it myself for around 6 months! Thumbs up !
1671,3.0,"noise isolation is good. But when we are in call or recording something, microphone catches even very small sounds from the surroundings. This will be very bad experience for the user at other end. I think this over smartness of microphone is useless. Otherwise this will be a very nice product in this price range."
1672,4.0,"It's good product but I feel no use of war hooks and I removed them from my headsets
Sound is fine
Bass is not soo clear as I expected
Overall if ur burget is 1500 can buy these"
1673,5.0,"Very much satisfied with the amazing sound with rich bass.
Very good battery backup.
Battery last for almost 10 to 12 hrs which is more than they claim for 8 hrs.
Got it in 999

This is my second earphones ..Now I got it in 1399. But very much satisfied with the bass and battery life.

Want to purchase again if I get it in that price again."
1674,4.0,"It's damn good.....i must agree that this is one of the best Bluetooth headsets in the market today..!
Decent Bass
Decent Sound quality
Decent looks
And Decent Battery life
But little bit expensive for such Decent Performance
But if u manage to get it for ₹999 in any sale then
Simple replace all Decent with Awesome in above lines......😅😅"
1675,1.0,Product is malfunctioning after 3 months and after sending back to warranty there is no response from the seller . No Response-Not Picking up Phone and No Mail reply after sending back to Warranty claim .
1676,1.0,"I am not really happy
I bought 2 earphones and both are defective
Amazon and boAt both are unable to help and solve the problem
Worst service from Amazon never expected this kind of service from Amazon
Please do not buy this product
Products are defective when you buy during ""Sale on Amazon""

I give zero rating for the service and product bought on Amazon"
1677,3.0,"It's slightly loose in case of fitting. If you move your neck continuously then it will come out from your ears. Sound quality is too good. As expected from BOAT. The main issue is after sometimes of connection via bluetooth, the rockerz 255 disconnects automatically. Don't why. Except that it's a very decent earphone in case of sound quality."
1678,1.0,"It's been more than a month, the sound quality has turned worse from best. . Sound quality is worst when i tried to increase the Bass. . While on calls, it's Bluetooth connectivity is low. I had used Boat earphones in the past . Wired earphones are the best in terms of sound quality . But this one . I am sorry . May be I ll have to buy a new bluetooth earphones soon"
1679,4.0,Everything is okay for me only problem is its ear buds. It's very painful when I use it in my resting time due to its design. Otherwise its bass is awesome. Sound quality is good
1680,4.0,"Amazing product got it on sale at 999 rs affordable at this price point sound quality is good battery backup 3.5-4hours depend on volume
Else wire quality aur improve ho sakti thi to acha hota else is everything is good"
1681,3.0,"It has been one month since I purchased this product. Now it is not charging. It shows battery charging but the moment I remove the charging plug it is not working.
Tried to reach out to the support number but that seems to an incorrect number. Also the support website is not working. NOT sure what to do now."
1682,3.0,"Sound/voice breaks when you use it while brisk walking , running ...also voice/sound breaks when you keep your mobile in backpocket . Good to use when you use it at still position .
Should come with aux point & cable so that can be used while it discharges"
1683,4.0,"I'm happy for the sound quality, bass etc.. except for poor bluetooth connectivity range. Overall it's a must to buy product with a budget around 1500 bucks."
1684,5.0,An excellent product. Sound quality is excellent. Rest noise cancellation and moisture wicking I have not tried. Overall an amazing product with very reasonable price.
1685,3.0,Overall build quality is good. Quality of sound is also good compared to the price. However not at all happy with the blue tooth connectivity when connected to phone. Audio as well as connectivity creates donations. Very often get complains from the other side as I'm not audible.
1686,1.0,"Worked like for 5 mins then it stopped. Light is not blinking, no lights at all . Tried to charge it but that also didn’t workout too.. packaging was terrible and the box was also damaged. They are supposed to send these items in a box but all they had was a bag of plastic without any bubble wrap. The seal looked like someone has opened it. Huge disappointment on the occasion of diwali. 😑"
1687,2.0,"Excellent sound quality as well as bass...Noise cancellation feature also works fine.. But the main problem is that we can't repair the earphone by the boat company and can't replace this item if damaged under warrenty also... Customer service of this brand is the worst as compared to other companies, they will never respond you if either register a complaint or not !! Buy at your own risk"
1688,2.0,"doesn't justify the price, sound is ok, battery life isn't good it gets drained out in 3 hours, shows incorrect battery status all the time so can't rely on it."
1689,1.0,"Within 4 months both the speaker got not working and I went to reclaim the warranty issue .They said warranty is not coming fpr whole product.
It very bad by paying 2.5 k for this bad headphones"
1690,5.0,Go for it.......very good ear phone in low price and specially for bass lovers but it regular price is 1500rs but i bought it in 899rs in festival offer.blutooth conevtivity is very fast and sound quality was awesome and noise cancellation is average.it comes with 1 year warranty. I got replaced my old damage earphone into new one within 15 days depending on area pincode.
1691,4.0,"Nice product at a price of 999. Sound quality and noise cancellation is good. Only problem I have noticed is that whenever it goes out of my Mobile's range, even for 2 seconds, it doesn't get connected automatically and I have to connect it manually again. Rest all looks ok.
I am using it for 3 days now and battery life, call quality etc is satisfactory.
Can't comment on durability at this stage."
1692,4.0,"I bought them for Rs1490, but if u can wait, u can buy them during sale, at that Time u can get them at Rs 900 to 1000 only. But itis good value for money. It is the first Bluetooth earthphones I have bought. It's sound quality is great.
Noise cancellation is good, not completely cancels but nice, sometimes I use them just to lower the outside noise."
1693,4.0,"Good quality headphone. You will feel that your money is not wasted. Buying a headphone without hearing is tough. I went with boAt name, and was not disappointed."
1694,5.0,"After trying multiple wired headphones , I bougth the boat rockerz headphone.
I have used them for jogging 3 to 4 times a week. I charge probably once a week.
Battery has a really comfortable charge.
Quality - 4 out of 5. Bass ids good
Comfort -4 out of 5 . depending on the size you can get the right fit."
1695,5.0,"I sometimes think that, has Boat made it accidentally or what. :D How come such deep bass in this price tag. I have Bose Free Soundsport, I sometimes feel that this one has deeper bass than Bose. But yes ofcourse Bose is Bose, in terms of sound clarity. 20times higher price. But still these two are comparable. Good work Boat."
1696,3.0,"The BOAT Rockerz are awesome with its features but unexpectedly it stopped working within 15 days. I took it to authorized service center to get it fixed or replaced and I had a bad experience. They charged me 200 Rs. for replacement.

Otherwise, the earphones are awesome. Inspite of the wire being slightly lengthy."
1697,5.0,"I am using this for last two months. Over all performance is very good. I am using only call purpose. Battary life is about to one day.
Call is very clear & loud."
1698,3.0,"May be a 3.5 kind of product. No complaints with sound quality or the comfort. Rockerz rock there.

Built quality looks a bit cheaper. The ear plugs cords are lengthy.. makes them wierd-looking.

Battery life deserves may be 4 or 4.5. it's that good actually."
1699,5.0,"It is very good bluetooth earphones at this price. The sound is very good. Once u plug it in, you cannont hear the outside noises. Though, there is an issue that there is no noise cancellation on calls. Otherwise it is very good."
1700,3.0,"I bought this for my friend. When he called me using the headset, his sound was not clear. Later I asked him about it. He told me that the sound quality of the earphones is good but the mic is not good."
1701,3.0,"Whenever i call somebody then the ring sounds very poor. It feels like watef is there inside the soeaker of headphone/earphone. It creates too much irritation. Along with this i couldn't experience any noice cancellation/reduction feature in this because during call (the people with whom i was talking), they were saying some disturbance from your side and the same I was feeling. So overall for listening music its good but for calling purpose its not a nice product to buy.
Thanks"
1702,4.0,"Good bass and sound at this (1000-1500 Rs) price.
Pathetic battery indicator, it will show 100%-80% till 4.5-5 hours and suddenly low battery indicator blinks.
Avg battery backup
Decent looks"
1703,1.0,I had purchased this item in March 19. It stopped working within 30 days. I contacted Boat qnd received 2nd item which again stopped working within 7 days. I again contacted boat and received 3 rd item which is not even getting power on. Now again I tried contacting Biat but not getting any response. Amazon is also not giving q convincing reply. They are simply asking me to contact Boat.
1704,1.0,"My Head phone of left side is not working. I am able to listen from right head set. There is no proper contact number of Boat to get the replacement. This product has one year warranty.

@ Amazon. You should never sell the product when there is no response from the vendor for the replacement. I have emailed but no response. I will go to consumer complaint soon and I file a case"
1705,1.0,"Very very very bad it's been only 3 months and it's one earphone is not working . One year warranty is useless no service centre service is there for help only waste of money
Let me tell you that don't buy this. Yes it's true that it's the best product you can get for the price (I doubt that) but definitely it's not the best product YOU should buy.
Big disappointment....

1706,2.0,"It's sound n noise cancellation is good , Battery Backup is good too. But after using for 1-2 month it one side shut down suddenly n also the caller in front can't hear your voice it's mic is below average. Also I faced Bluetooth range problem when I connect it to my phone and keep my phone in my pocket it just disconnect....
I have place a replacement. So let's see"
1707,5.0,"I was using Sennheiser CX275. Now i shifted to this product. Music quality is the only drawback.
1. Wireless - 5 Star
2. Calls - 5 Star
3. Music - 3 Star (compared to Sennheiser CX275)
4. Movies - 5 Star
5. Price - 4 Star (Value for money)
Over All - 4.5 Star"
1708,1.0,"Noise cancelation is very poor.
Recipient not able to listen anything while traveling!!!
And battery backup is not as they claim.
Just for calls it lasts for 2-3hrs max!!!
Don't ask about standby time.... Standby time is also very poor.
Not satisfied with this product...

Not recommended!!!"
1709,1.0,"Best in price segment, me n my 4 frnds purchased this earphones, every one is facing problem now. Its one side earphone stopped working within some months only.
Compared to my Samsung 400rs wired earphones which I purchased 3 yrs ago, still working fine."
1710,4.0,Good product but not comfortable in ear it make some disturbing sound when listening at low volume I am not sure why this is happening may be it is there will all wireless earphones which make unclear sound. Battery is good but after reaching 60 percentage it fall very quickly.bass is superb best bass earphones.
1711,4.0,"Worth at this prize.. connectivity is moderate some time get connectivity issue
Interm of charging .. it's not managed effectively
For me coming 12 hr standby mode without on call ..I recommend they should improve this"
1712,1.0,I used it for 4 months and now its not working properly. Its stopping in between and i have to switch it on again and again even though it has been conected to the device. Battrey is fully charged still it gets stopped in between and i have to start it again. In a minute i have to start 4-5 times again amd again
1713,3.0,"This will become junk after using it for 3 months - will start giving trouble in connectivity, visibility (discovering/pairing issue).

Did warranty claim also but no use, repeating the same."
1714,5.0,"Hey Guys,
I bought boAt Rockerz 255 Sports Bluetooth Wireless Earphone & I am completely satisfied with this product. Its really awesome and I am loving this Earphone easy to connect with awesome sound quality. If connected on call it works well and reduce the noise I mean noise cancellation works well. The person I was speaking to cannot identify I was using Earphone. Its value for money."
1715,4.0,"I am facing an issue with this set, a beeping sound can be heard while listening songs which is irritating. And the headset is different from the one which me and my 34 friends ordered it before. Must be an upgrade but the beeping sound is really irritating. Rest i am a big fan of Boat. Please help me with this. It was a gift for my dad."
1716,5.0,I had purchased for my wife but ear plugs are big for her now i am using due to its sound quality is very good n i can connect to my tv to watch online movies n series on prime n netflix
1717,3.0,Sound quality for music is good but not at all good for voice calls. The mic pics alot of surrounding noise. There is no noise cancellation for mic. Build quality is also bad. The clip that fits in the ear comes out and moves in the groove. This happened after only after a month.
1718,1.0,"If you are buying for taking calls, pls DON'T.
All the ambient noise comes through the mic.
What boat calls as noise cancelling could be noise getting into your ear... But the mic is pathetic.
I have Jabra evolve 40 which are wired and I wanted to go wireless. Rockerz 255 are not even 1% of them."
1719,1.0,"Don’t buy this product. Battery is dead just after 3 months.
Boat service is very poor. It’s almost 1 month i have raised the complaint and no action has been taken.
They will give you a confirmation that the complaint has been raised but no pickup will be attempted afterwards.
Even after getting in touch with there support staff for over five times, nothing has been done."
1720,4.0,"Boat Rockerz 255 Is Amazing.
Sound Quality Is Best.
Value For Money.
Powerfull Bass.
Design Is Best And Black Colour Is Best.
Very Comfortable And I Use Continue 7hr.
Battery Life Better But Over All I Use This Earphone in 60% Volume So Battey Life Are 9hr Easy On.
But One Problem 10mm Connection This Are Problem But Anyway Is A Best Wireless Earphone Neckband."
1721,3.0,"It's one the worst product I saw... Its not working. Some prblm occurred within one month and even the repose of customer service and for replacement if too poor. Even after the grievance no. Resposnse
07015660510"
1722,5.0,"I liked the brand as it serves the product as exactly as it describes in the package.. Besides it is easy to use and provides complete nirvana as the brand claims to be. Buy this product, specially when you get any deal or offer when the price will be around 999/-."
1723,2.0,"Sound quality is ok...
Battery backup is not so good and battery indicator is inaccurate. It will show 80% now and after ten mins it will go off saying battery low"
1724,1.0,"I'll keep it brief. Don't buy this item unless you are ok with choppy interrupted music. Also, the ergonomics suck big time.

I hope amazon filters my review and you find this useful in avoiding your purchase. I decided to return the item within minutes of using it (and I'm usually quite patient). So you can now take a call.

Good luck... God Bless"
1725,1.0,I cannot hear the voice of the person clearly in this Bluetooth device. It was properly working at the beggining but now when I am in a call its frequently disconnecting so for that I need to restart the device again.. Similarly when I am listening to music.. Its disconnecting again and again. This is very irritating. So expensive things are not even working for 1 month. Dissapointed.
1726,1.0,"Sound quality is good but mic is very poor. Other person cannot hear me properly.

After 4 months of usage one side stopped working. Their customer care is also poor. They say they have option to register online complain but they keep on sending me address to their service center which is like 20 km in Bangalore."
1727,4.0,"Go for it. Good during bike riding. One time
full charge will last for 3 days, in my case.
This does it work.
But Boat need to make more smart Bluetooth earphones."
1728,5.0,"Easy to use and connected easily. One touch button is very useful. Sound quality is good. Good noise cancellation, fit it in ears. I have referred to my friends."
1729,4.0,"Product is fine with 4-6 hr talktime. What I dislike about this product is the length of cord which is quite long and sometimes irritate.
Otherwise as a Bluetooth headphone... Good product"
1730,5.0,"- Connects to the device very easily no set up problem.
- Good for calling and day to day use.
- I use it while riding bike and in gym.
- Good and clear sound quality. Listening songs is fun on these.
- Just go for them."
1731,1.0,"I raised a request to return this earphones in just two days after purchase. I use OnePlus 6T while play pubg squad members can't hear my voice clearly, the rubber which is giving with earphones is not that soft quality, ears will start burning after 30 to 40 minutes of usage. I don't recommend it"
1732,3.0,dont buy it.. i have purchased this in may 2019. i was getting an issue in left speaker in september2019. i have submitted for replacement. it will take one month to come back. again now i am facing an issue with button like i am not able to pick up the call if i press the middle button then it is getting disconnected. so again i am putting for replacement. dont buy from this seller.
1733,1.0,"Product's battery performance is worst. Seriously regretting for opting replacement. From 100% it comes to 60% within 1 hour and from 60% it comes directly to 20% in 20 minutes and then it comes to 0% within 7 minutes. In short it just works for only 90 minutes.

Amazon is requested to stern action on such happenings. Ultimately it's Amazon's name which is getting degraded."
1734,4.0,"All good as-far-as u are not on Wi-Fi.
If u are on Wi-Fi, u won't be able to hear a thing, scrambled voice.

Other than this issue - all well."

1736,1.0,"It takes about an hour or so to charge the battery to be 100% , however just about 80% and 5 minutes later the headphones is switched off. Rest all is ok but if the battery ain't good what's the point in buying this no matter what the discount. Disappointed"
1737,4.0,"The product is highly light weight, suitable for joggers & gymnasium freaks. Also since it is Sweat proof & water proof makes it highly compatible with the above mentioned users. The bass is terrific. The noise cancellation is up to the mark. Supports Google Assistant with a one second press of the power key.

Got it for 1499 just a little over 24 hours of order.

1740,2.0,Earphone stopped working after 3 months. Service center people refused to entertain warranty claim as it was purchased online and not in any shop. Avoid!
1741,3.0,"Ok buy for the price and basic use case - bluetooth connectivity to phone while driving.

Not so comfortable to wear and noise cancellation is just marketing for this product, doesn't work."
1742,5.0,Completely perfect product. Sound quality is really awesome. I'm real sound quality seeking guy. The product meet my requirements. Super bass and clear sound as well. It really plays all kind of frequencies. Noises cancelled by 97%. It's genuinely toched me. Thank you BoAt. Thank you Amazon.
1743,5.0,"Bass boost sound, battery life good 5 to 6 hours best little bit problem in bluetooth connectivity, i purchased ₹ 899 gis and this price good pro"
1744,1.0,"Over all the product is nice but battery backup is horrible it hardly last for 3 hours while playing game... I bought this to play pubg but unfortunately i am not able to enjoy it... I wish to return it.
Dont buy ds as after 6 months of ussage the sound quality and volume lowers. Sound cancellation dsnt work at all"
1745,4.0,Voice is breaking in between calls and battery life is also not good as expected. But You can go for it if you are buying for music & also comfortable to wear. Better think about the battery life once before going for it. As per my overall experience I will give 4.2 rating.
1746,4.0,Boat headset Mast hai sound quality bass ek dum mast voice call ke awaj tode Kam hai low hai voice call ke awaj but earphones ke quality ek Mast hai battery life bhi badeya hai 8/9 hours bas problem hai to voice call ke jo ke awaj tode Kam hai voice call ke awaj ka dekhna chahiye.. Bake sab thik hai boat earphones quality best 👍👍🤙
1747,4.0,"Boat rockerz is good in sound quality, connectivity. But when it comes in comparision with realme earbuds, then the boat lacks behind. In Realme earbuds if bods earbuds are connected with magnet then the audio stops and it saves the battery of the earbud. But when the earbuds of boat are connected with magnet the sound does'nt stops."
1748,4.0,"I have been using this product for two months now, no complain whatsoever, it has quick charge and the bass is pretty good too. If you are looking for headphones under the roof of 1500, you can go for it. I like the various colour options they have and the built quality is also decent. In an all, best low budget bluetooth headhphone."
1749,2.0,"I used this product for 15 days, had issues with bluetooth connectivity, had to keep on restarting the product to connect to multiple devices. Battery works like around 5-6 hrs max, charges quickly though{using fast charger}. Mic is not stable, has a lot of noises for the other person to hear you. Sound quality is good."
1750,5.0,Close your eyes(skeptic eyes)... Scroll the page to buy now.... And check out..... Simple..... Has a battery back up of more than 8 hours if your use is judicious.... I have not chrged it ever since I bought it and this is after 2 days of purchase....

Also battery backup is less. Rest is ok."
1758,4.0,"Sound quality not as expected. Used boat wired ear phones earlier. Compared to that it is not effective. Old piece having issue with left side after using 1 year. But I preferred boat again because of quality,but disappointed with wireless piece."
1759,5.0,"Standard issue with any kind of bluetooth device hanging around neck.
It must be resolved around all such bluetooth headset.

Apart from that sound quality is 6 on 5 it's perfectly best.

Connectivity is good.

Only issue is strap it has lost it shape due to regular usage"
1760,5.0,"These earphones are awesome and there is no trouble with them. Those who are saying that they don't have bass are wrong i have used them and the bass is seriously pretty strong for wireless earphones in such a price range. They are not over priced as well. Moreover while talking over them the person on the other side also didn't face any difficulty hearing me. These earphones are great, I personally highly recommend these."
1761,3.0,"Sound quality is not bad, but not as expected (compared to wired boat earphones).
The battery life is considerably good, its as mentioned (6hrs+)
I found little lag in sound of around half a second(~300 to 400ms), while watching a movie which made me to give 3 stars.
The product physical quality is appreciable, good quality of thick wiring is used."

1764,5.0,The product is very gud.. Gud music quality.. Gud call quality..very heavy bass...Fits properly into the ears... Very gud while running and exercise... Only problem is the distance... The connection breaks as soon as the device is 20ft farther...
1765,4.0,"Till date best headphones I had. It is nice product, however few time I do face disturbance while I'm listening to music. Also there is no indicator for Low Battery warning. All of sudden a voice comes which says oops battery low n the Bluetooth is switched off. Rest all is awesome."
1766,5.0,"The best wireless earphones in this price. I get it for only 900 rupees. The sound quality is amazing and the noise cancellation is also very good. Only the problems I get sometimes is in the bluetooth connection. It doesn't show it when u pair it with new phone.
Although this is very good earphones. Battery backup is also very good.
Must buy product"
1767,4.0,"Mike sensor should be improved, the person we are talking with can listen to every single noise so clear be it traffic , water, horn so badly loud and this makes it impossible for him/her to listen to what I am saying.

And Bluetooth range is also not ok till next room I can't go without phone"
1768,1.0,"I ve a very bad experience regarding this product. After 1 month of buying sound quality be among very poor infact it's not audible in one side. And after raising complain the service centre agent collected the bluetooth,but its already 20 days left, I m neither able to connect their customer care nor able to tracking my bluetooth service complain by the tracking I'd given to me"
1769,5.0,"Nice sound quality.
Don't expect heavy bass as the boat provided with their wired headsets.
Decent battery backup. Takes 2 hrs for charging.

Disappointed with the mic's performance...
Its not the noise cancellation. Its noise boosting 😁 person at the earpiece end can hear the noise better than our voice.

Review after one month heavy usage..."
1770,1.0,"Bought this thinking that boat is a known company and would give a good quality and better after sales service. But i was wrong as its after sales is worst than its sound Quality! Battery is worst!! Just 2 hours of backup. Registered complain online on boat’s official website, no revert till date!
Worst service, Worst Product."
1771,1.0,"Writting this review within a month after buying this one. Literally, I've been cheated by this product. I thought of buying it after seeing good reviews but the left side is totally off withing 24-25 days.
Totally pissed off!"
1772,1.0,One ear set not working and product within warranty pls arrange to replace
1773,4.0,"Too much bass. Due to the extra bass vocals and some instrumental separations are affected.
For a bass lover its the choice.
I personally dont love too much bass.
But boAt service is top notch. Love boAts customer service."
1774,5.0,"True review- sound quality is not that much good,but it is ok. Build quality could be more durable.overall build quality is not good or everyday use. User will always expect the build quality for daily use but I don't think it's good battery is amazing.comfort is amazing."
1775,5.0,Before buy this I was really concerned because on youtube people said that the material isn't good and wires r thin but now after using it for a while I can say it's really good no problem with the material and headphones won't look good if wires were anymore thicker great sound quality as always and decent connectivity 🔋 life is about 5 to 6 hours
1776,4.0,I have heard better sounding headsets and was honestly a bit disappointed for the quantity of sound. The mids and lows are not up to the mark. It's good for voice only application.
1777,5.0,"Sound quality is good
Great bass
When you plug them you will not be able to listen other sounds
If you are using then for too long you ears will start hurting
Sometimes it Hurts in the helmet"
1778,5.0,"Fast connectivity.
Noise free sound.
Well fitting & comfy ear plugs.
Quality of sound good but BASE tends to be stronger.
9 / 10 score"
1779,1.0,"Earphones are good. But it had a problem after 6 months and I returned the product as it is in the warranty period on 30th September,2019(when navrathri started)
It has been 2 weeks but my product reached Mumbai service center from then the product has not replaced and now Diwali is coming and my earphones are not coming.......☹️
Very pathetic response from boat team."
1780,3.0,Person on the other side of the phone hears a lot of surrounding noise when i use this earphone for calling...And I have confirmed this issue from many of my friends who are also using this earphone...They all are facing this issue...And it is really irritating for the person on the other side..Rest are good.. Battery is huge..12 hours max on moderate use..Sound quality is okay
1781,4.0,"Good sound quality, very long battery life(6/8hours continous) , waterproof material.. Easy and comfort to wear, travel..
Problems wire length needs little more small. Bluetooth connectivity average 10m."
1782,5.0,Product looks good awesome sound quality.. nice product for the price and its my second BOAT earphones ... Its really good and i prefer this for who love to listen music ..BOAT is Great
1783,5.0,"I bought them in 899 in offer . The built quality is very good . The sound quality and bass is best as compared to this range bluetooth earphones.
All over value for money item and reliable. the Packaging is very good and impressive. I just got it in 2 days thankyou amazon ."
1784,3.0,"Its very good for songs listening
But i got problem with gaming
Because there is 1-2 second delay on audio
I replaced the product but again I am faced that problem
Don't buy this for gaming
Very very disappointed with that"
1785,5.0,"Great sound quality and bass was purely classic with this price it is great product from great brand.
Durability look good let's see in long term i gifted this to someone so i can't tell you about battery life but i tried this once for its condition and I'm in love with this I'll buy for myself too"
1786,5.0,"After a long search finally decided to go with this product, Getting slight distortion while receiving any notification and noise cancellation is OK other than that I love this product very much, it is too comfortable and audio quality is excellent, at this cost it is an excellent product, worth for money and highly recommended, Thank you all for the reviews and Thanks Amazon."
1787,1.0,Sound quality is ok but if problem occurs in device then replacement is very worst it takes too much time and the staff on call is very rude.....and usually they say that the product is out of stock it takes nearly a month to replace this device......am using rockerz since feb and now they are not working properly mic is not working as well as left side is not working properly
1788,4.0,"I using this from 3 months,
Battery is good 6 hours backups.
Sound Quality is Very Good.
Comfortable with 👂 is good after using someday.
Noise cancellation is not working."
1789,5.0,"I got this product during one of Amazon many sale periods. It cost me Rs. 999/-. For the price it is an awesome product. I use it mostly to speak over phone calls and gives me a comfortable battery time of a little more than a day. With music on for most of the day, the batter lasts for a little less than a day.

With the price in mind, its a sure BUY recommendation."
1790,3.0,"guys dont buy it.sound quality is good but bluetooth range is bad even it doesn't cross single wall.i have return my headphone as its bluetooth doesn't work after 3-4 mt.When another piece i received its bluetooth is ok but again not up to the mark.
DonT buY"
1791,2.0,Does what its made for but causes pain in the ears if used for little longer than even half an hour. I tried changing the plugs on ears but that does not solve the issue since the inner part of earpiece is super hard

1793,4.0,Honest review..base is so awesome and i also tried listening the bluetooth quality and it some times buffer..But overall packaging and quality is good.I got it in 999rs so it's fine with me
1794,5.0,After using it for 3 weeks I'm giving this review.. i bought it for 1200.. Sound quality is good with more bass.. if u don't want that much bass means u can change the hear bud to a smaller one.. Quality of the product is also good i guess it will be a durable one.. Battery life is ultimate.. If u use it for 3 hrs a day it will last for 1 week.. Since I'm using it for my gym I feel very comfortable with this battery life..
1795,2.0,"Bought on 8th September 2018
With in 4 month both ear buds are not working. I made a request for replacement after the 1 month I got the replacement for my earphone .
I got new earphone from boat .

After 2 month I could not be able to charge my earphone ...both ear buds have problem I could not be able to hear sound clearly .

Don't buy it .

I have worst experience with boat."
1796,1.0,iIRaise complaint For Boat Rockerz 255 Sports My Rights Side earphone Not Working. Company Replace My Product But I Think Thats Not Boat Rockerz 255 Sports Its Different So Please Check With u r Team What u Given in Replacement product & Replacement Product Quality Also Not Good
1797,1.0,Bought at 1000 RS. Ears get warmer within few minutes. Harmful for ears . Rather use wired or costly wireless headphones. Don't go for cheap wireless options and prevent ur ears from getting damaged.
1798,1.0,Everything is good...but what if the earphones are not connecting to phone easily....even you can't off the Bluetooth of the headset... If u disconnected with the phone and pressed it power button once than you have to wait for it to automatically off the Bluetooth than start it again and reconnect it...Worst thing it is... If you are ok with this then buy it...
1799,3.0,"Good quality...strong build quality. It fell down on a train platform accidentally and got stomped on by kolkata crowd. I had lost all hope of over getting it back in single piece, surprisingly it took no damage except two little scratches. I am writing this review after this incident."
1800,4.0,"Everything is good at this price range, just one thing I didn't like was the length of the wire, boat should provide more long wires for the earphones as it hangs on your ear and neck, rest everything is very good, happy with the product😀🙂one more thing is the quality of calling is not so nice, you can't hear voices clearly..."
1801,5.0,"Nose cancellation is not really upto the mark. Bluetooth connectivity is pretty ok. The sound however is simply fab! You'll surely love it if you're a bass lover!
Overall it's a good product though."
1802,4.0,The headset range and the battery backup is good. Superb bass but sound quality is poor for treble. Lack of sound clearance and the MIC is not clear to the receivers end during phone call.
1803,4.0,Best earphones I like it... Sound quality is nice . But bass is low... Everything good for this price... And this is value for money... I got small problem for my product... I hope .. replacement product will be good ...
1804,1.0,"I bought this headphone hoping that it would be sturdy. I generally use headphones while travelling listening mostly study related videos. So bass is not a selling factor for me. While it has good sound quality, it is really fragile. I kept this in my office bag for my daily office travel ; used mostly while in commute. After 3 months one bud stopped working."
1805,2.0,The audio quality is really very poor. Only bass and low mids are present. No highs. I don't know whether it was faulty piece or it just sounds like that only! Returned it.
1806,4.0,"Overall good product in terms of sound quality and bass. Though the cords a bit too long, keeps on dangling , could have been a little more less in length for more stability."
1807,3.0,This headset is okay. Doesn't have a very good sound quality. Go with Mivi collar if you want better sound quality. But if you have budget of Rs 1500 then these are fine.
1808,4.0,"I have been using since 1 day and build quality was great , I use boat rockerz 225 headphones which has very good bass when compared to this but at this price range it is best
Pros:
🔋 Battery Life was simply superbb
Connectivity is fast
Sound quality is good and bass is punchy
Build Quality Is good as per price of 999/-
Cons :
Wire is long"
1809,3.0,"First of all the package deal has been already broken and it seems to-be used by someone.
Then the voice is not that much of greater
Third voice cancellation is not perfect."
1810,4.0,"If you're looking for a sporty wireless earphones with mic, go for it. Highly durable,well suited for workout sessions due to it's moisture wicking feature. I'm in love with the lightweight and comfortablity. Battery life is good (over 6 hours). Sound quality is above average vis-a-vis other Bluetooth earphones in the given price range. Noise cancellation, there's room for improvement."
1811,1.0,"These earphones have good sound and good bass to it but it breaks very easily. I’m hoping I can get a refund or a new pair. It worked well for few months but all of a sudden the left ear piece stopped working. This has happened to my friends also so I’m not the only one facing this problem.
Hope I can get a new one because I suffering with any earphones.
Thank you"
1812,3.0,"I had purchased this on May 2019.. now it's October.. collapsed.. even though it has no noise cancellation on phone calls and big disturbance on calls, it had performed well for other like listening musics and others till last month. Then problems comes..first voice breaking during calls then voice breaking on listening music too..now right ear piece is not working at all.."
1813,3.0,"This product is ok for listening music. But for calling seems not good. I have faced many issue while calling. Voice is not clear, in between the calling voice cuts automatically.

Battery backup is good for listening music. But if you continuously use for calling then you need to carry the charger alsong with head phones.

Over all performance is ok ok."
1814,1.0,"I got the damaged product from amazon. No sound clarity, Heavey voice disturbance. Voice clarity is not good. Amazon packaging also not good. And the very important thing is, when I open the amazon product pack, inside the product box is not sealed, the box is already in open state. Then how can it trust, this product is new one and original like. Totally I am disappointed."
1815,2.0,"I reduced two stars from my average, because of its battery life , it lasts for 4-5 hours . Worst part is , at one moment it shows you battery 80% and other moment its keeps on repeating , ""oops , battery low "" thats the most irrigating part ."
1816,2.0,"I have had a very bad experience with these. A month after using these the left ear bud started distorting and the volume control started heating up. I had written a complaint and they were exchanged within 15 days. Yes, they have really good customer service. But even the new device started malfunctioning in a similar manner, really disappointed after seeing that. But I have got to say that Boat has really good customer service."
1817,3.0,"Actually Right side ear pod is not working. There is no any sound and that’s why I want to return the product. When your amazon person came yesterday for return pick up the product my home was locked and return request canceled and I got sms to re schedule the return but it does not worked. So need help.
Waiting forcyour further assistance.
Thanks"
1818,3.0,"Like : sound is nice
Dislike : product life span is very less around 7months only. now i ask warranty claim not support by amazon team also.
Warranty card present to company means they doesn't accept it also they replies get ticket from amazon after that only we check its own Boat rockerz 255 product. but amazon customer care is not support to me."
1819,4.0,Nice product which I have bought few months back but lately it has started disconnecting in middle of a conversation or while I am listening to music
1820,2.0,"Hello All,
I received this product yesterday evening, i had bought it in Great indian festival offer..
When i opened the packet i felt that its beem already used by someone before.
Because I didnt get the feel of new product..
It looks like some one has returned it and the same one repacked and sold it to me...
:( :("
1821,5.0,"Hello Everyone,

I also thank Amazon company for delivering inaccurate time. I am thanking Boat and Amazon Company to Provide me a Good and Medium Price.

Thank you,
Rishi Jain"
1822,5.0,"It is the best earphones I ever saw. It's sound quality is best with a very good bass, It is comfortable to use u can easily wear it for 5-6 hours, it's battery backup is really good u can use it for whole day in one charge, when u wear it , it cancelles the outer sound u just hear it's sound . If Ur watching for a budget neckband earphones u should buy it. Thanks for reading full review...."
1823,4.0,"It has been a month, battery goes upto 6 7 hrs easily, but the battery indicator is all fake, cuz suddenly it will drop to dead, also the low battery notification comes just 2 or 3 mins before shutdown. Sound quality is almost good, connectivity range is not more than 10 m for an open area, if walls are within then it won't get very good to the second room"
1824,1.0,After receiving the product I used it for some days one day suddenly stopped working I returned the product I received replacement but now again the replacement product also stopped working after few days of use...... So I think it's manufacturing fault in the product.... Please don't waste your hard earned money
1825,5.0,This is the one of the best earphone I had .... I just have no words to tell.... Just I will say go get it blind folded ... Believe me u won't b disappointed.
1826,4.0,Overall this product is excellent. The quality of sound and earbuds are awesome. Really liked it. Only reason for not giving 1 more star is that sometimes it have disturbance in connectivity. I think this is some bluetooth issue. But that happens rarely. I'll still recommend this product.
1827,4.0,"If they give additional locking buds it'd be good. some times it gives pain when we use long time. if you want to hear best out of this earphone use small buds provided with this model. because when u use bigger one u'll get great bass but u'll not hear treble. I changed it with small bud, it's sounds great and clear."
1828,3.0,"Decent wireless earphones but after use of 5 months one side of the item stops working . And when goes through the boats complaint section of this product max of the people were complaining about the same issue. Though they have pick up and drop facilities depends on your city but they didn't did that in my situation .
So buy carefully ... Thanks ."
1829,4.0,"One of the best budget Bluetooth headset. It has a decent amount of bass, a bit lacking in volume. The passive noise cancellation is great. The product is definitely worth it's price. The delivery was fast too."
1830,4.0,"It connects effortlessly via bluetooth..
The response is also good unless you're playing pubg there's a second delay in response..
Other than pubg the sound response is good.."
1831,5.0,"The first song I played felt a little off as I switched directly from my sony wired earphones worth Rs 4000. But after 2-3 songs, I realized that the sound is really good. Fit is also solid, I guess I can sprint without fearing them to fall out. Songs have good clarity, way more than I was expecting at this price. Go for it!"
1832,4.0,"Pros:
Bass(9/10)
Durability(9/10)
Build quality(9/10)
Confortable(8/10)
Sticking to you ears(10/10)
Nise cancellation (9/10)

Cons:
Battery life could have been better(7/10)
Sound clearity (6/10)
And some time it breaks the audio."
1833,5.0,"Great earphones. Recommended anytime. Only thing I didn't like is the length of the wire is long, because of which it felt little irritating if you are wearing it during running. Leaving this aside, it is best in class earphones. Very strong built."
1834,5.0,"This is simply brilliant. Sound quality is excellent. Noise cancellation is really good. It really blocks out the surrounding noise very well.

Worth the money? Definitely yes. Two thumbs up for this product."
1835,1.0,Worst product one side stopped within 2months no service by boat no one responding
1836,2.0,Don't buy it. Within 3 months right ear phone stopped working. And there is no option of calling customer care or claiming for warranty. Don't waste your money..
1837,5.0,"One of the best in-ear phone that I have ever used it so far.. This one rely rocks..
Amazing sound quality and one of the lightest ear phone suits very well for most of the sports activities..."
1838,4.0,"Somehow, the life of the earbuds is very less. While the company immediately exchanges the product, you have to take the pain of going to the service centre and do the formalities. Wouldn't want such additional stress."
1839,3.0,"Though it is a good shift from wired earphones to a Bluetooth earphone. And the bass level is also good.. but sound clarity is not very good.. but in this price point it is recommended product.
I use it daily for 2-3 hours and charge it on every 3rd or 4th day."
1840,3.0,Built quality good but bass is not punchy. Its loud which make unnecessary grove in each beat. Even in voice call also it sound bad due to over bass
1841,1.0,I would like to rate it as zero if there is any option. Bought this product two months back and earhook broke and fell off on its own. Such a disappointment with the manufacturing. I want a replacement of the product otherwise the money is wasted. No customer service available in Kolkata that I can reach to. Amazon should stop selling defective products.
1842,2.0,"Overall good sound and a very good base, but the biggest issue is the buds support. If you remove these silicon support arch buds this earphone is nothing. Without these support the earplugs slipping out which is very disappointing for me."
1843,2.0,"when i first received the buttons were very very hard, even if i press also it was not taking, and then had to return it and got an exchange, and now after 6 months, the right part stopped working suddenly"
1844,5.0,"Using this for he past two months- the sound is balanced with adequate lows, mids and highs. While the bass is ok for normal listeners, don’t expect much if you are a bass head. Wished a better version of Bluetooth was given for more seamless experience; it sometimes losses connection when the mobile is in pocket. Overall, a good buy at this price point"
1845,4.0,Although Boat Rockers 255 is Good but it have some negative sides are The Charging cable is too shot and the charging port is very hard and it's too difficult to insert the charging cable every time and the lid used to cover the charging port is not good enough .It will be better when the Boat rockers when provide a charger
1846,5.0,"its value for money product.i bought at 899.good products in this price range.
after using my review is sound quality is good.
comfertnes is ok.unble to uae more than 1hr.battery life is alao good more than 18 hrs i used in single charge."
1847,4.0,"I like sound quality. But i got one problem, when I connected with mobile, then wifi speed is decreasing. Sometimes it will disconnect and connected again. Except this everything is good"
1848,5.0,"Its the product i was looking for the long time, after long research i ordered this here on amazon. the fastest every delivery i got. what quality product from boAt, this the second prodct after boAt stone. fanatastic prodct. Buy with eyes closed. Nomber 1"
1849,3.0,My right side earphone not working properly. The sounds getting echo sometime and sometime it's automatically disabled. I tried to call on the customer support number of boat-lifestyle but it shows wrong. please help me with this issue.
1850,5.0,Just what I needed Comfort 100%. Bluetooth range more than enough n perfect clarity in sound. A bit bass improvement could have been innovated into this design.
1851,4.0,"Major asset is the bass quality and noise cancellation, good one under 1000 but may be we have to look up for the battery life as of now single charge I'm able to use it for 3 days"
1852,1.0,"T'he product is not as per my expectations, it got disconnect automatically in between (though it has enough battery life) and you have to establish the connection again. Sometimes it work and sometimes it don't. In just 38 days the the product has lost its life and now is completely dead."
1853,5.0,"Got this for rs 999. Such a steal! Although battery life should’ve been designed for more than 6 hours, I got no other reason to complain. The red colour looks really good. Go for it."
1854,4.0,"Sound only litle less all other good.
After 2 day usage
Pros:
Sound 4*
Bass 4.5*
Noice cancellation 4.7*
Nice battery backup
Best at 999rps

Cons:
Battery remaining is not showing properly
Need extra sound
While batery low ,not audible sounds properly"
1855,3.0,Iam not happy with this because it doesn't have good battery life.. so quickly battery drains after listening some music.. buyers should cross check when you're buying this..
1856,1.0,The rigt side of the earphone just does not give any sound output . Suddenly the right side stopped working and even after multiple restarts it just does not work . Everything happening on the 22nd day of delivery (now i can't retrurn) and the usage has been for not more than 10 days for 2-3 hours each . Horrible product and a complete waste of money .
1857,5.0,"What I liked
1. Good battery back up
2. Optimum/Economical pricing
3.Build quality for an emerging brand- it's sturdy
4. Sound quality-if you are bass lover
What I didn't like
1.Too much on the bass side. Sound is not balanced.
2. Once you plug it you are disconnected from your surroundings. Not a pleasant experience."
1858,2.0,Bought this earphones few days back. Average sound quality and very pathetic in noise cancellation. Noise beyond few meters catch like they are within few inches of mic. Don’t buy if you are looking for noise cancelling earphones. Bluetooth connection hampers even if you put mobile in left pocket.
1859,2.0,"After 3 months of use right side speaker stop working, called to customer care, you can connect to their customer care 1 time out of 10 tries, taking so much time, after spending 1500 rs you have to wait for service is pathetic, i prefer to buy some other brands like samsung and sony who own a service centre in local area."
1860,4.0,"Product and audio quality is excellent. But concern is everytime you have to power On and Off which is time consuming and sometimes person forgets to power off which is something drain of battery.
Also, there is nothing to do with magnet as of now. Even if you keep magnet in contact no action performed.(no power off)."
1861,1.0,"Bluetooth is very easy to connect but the noise cancellation is very bad.. Also after 10 days the sound quality decreased..

I am not sure if anyone else is facing the same problem.. But i am facing it.. Now i am not able to hear any sound from one of its ear bud and from the other one it is very low.."
1862,5.0,"This is 2nd time in a row i purchased the same product in 3 years, first i bought this 2years back but that got damaged due to my fault so again i came to search for any other good one i can't find any other perfect products like this in this price, so again i purchase the same product"
1863,2.0,"Sound is good & light weight comfortable to use, but mic is not good as accepted. While talking others sounds in notice is very high hence others person can not able to listen our voice properly."
1864,3.0,"While iam doing jogging or workout at out door it was keep on strucking or suddenly stops
After useage of 4 months while I was on a call suddenly it was disconnected and not able to call through earphones I had to switched to ear mode
Iam not satisfied with this product"
1865,5.0,"Very good sound quality, battery life and Bass👌
But when We will keep in pocket getting some distribution and not connecting properly, voice or song fluctuating. otherwise good"
1866,2.0,"These ain't worked for me. I din like the overall sound signature.
Bass is okayish din have the thump as described in many reviews, the overall loudness is also low.
I've used them in POCO F1 and Redmi note 7pro.
Finally returned the product. as its not the value for money product."
1867,4.0,Product is good at pocket friendly price. As per the product is concerned the sound quality is good and bass is average. So excellent for daily use with standby power and 7 to 8 hrs of playback power. And great design. Overall a good experience for me. Water repellent features enable us to carry on with mild Mumbai rains.
1868,5.0,"Earphone with a good sound quality (9/10),noise cancelation is quite good (7/10), Battey life is average but doesn't bother you so much if you have fully charged (7/10).
Overall I've gotta very nice and a satisfactory performance from this product(8/10) (hence reviewing this almost 3months later) and it is best in range and also seek for sale from my suggestion."
1869,2.0,After sale service zero..No given on Amazon site 022 3014 7239 is in valid...The soft ear buds & two clone which holds on ears fail off.. other wise the performance is ok ..
1870,3.0,Just bass Is good other that it was worse. It lacks of instrument separation & when we kept the phone in pant pocket song will breaks(it will play like a loose connection in the wire). If you are in outdoor and taking calls you had to put mic near your mouth otherwise outdoor sounds will be heard by another person instead of our voice.
1871,4.0,Since this support lower bluetooth getting delay in voice while playing online gaming like pubg. Sound is clear but bass is not better. I would suggest to buy 255R for better bass quality. Not found any issue in noise cancellation. I would say its budget earphone with better build & sound quality. Expecting higher version of bluetooth.
1872,5.0,"best quality , good sound, must buy
After all BoAt service is also good if any problems happened with in 1 year then they repair or replace the product ."
1873,2.0,"When I am taking call through this earphones, unable to communicate properly with next person on call may be due to poor Bluetooth connection. Also my original product stopped working in weeks time and the replaced one has the aforementioned problem. And the colour of replaced product is different than my original product. Not happy with the product."
1874,4.0,"First of all ...delievery is much panthatic..otherwise everything is Good..
Meet mine expectations nearby.....not much effective in Bass bt it is powerfull..I am a MUSIC LOVER mostly for BASS and it is perfect for me...whivh is not best but better than others...all r perfect in this Range....GO AHEAH FOR THIS...
👍 Thanks for a geat deal in 999/- Amazon..."
1875,1.0,Pathetic service from boat. I raised a request for replacement within warranty period as the left side stopped working. They picked the product on time but no update after that. 3 months have passed and I have still not received the replacement nor they are repairing it. Customer service number is useless as they never take your call.
1876,4.0,"Everything is fine , just found 2 problems,
1) mic is not too sensitive, sometimes i have to put mic near my face.
2) After using around 1 month, the battery is draining very fast.

Maybe its a problem. Trying to contact customer care, hope they will listen to me."
1877,1.0,"Very much disappointed with the performance and color of the product.
The color shown in pictures is totally different from what I received.
Performance wise very worat in battery backup... It drains so quick even in standby..
Call quality is okay, not great"
1878,2.0,"Received Headset today. Will point Cons directly :
1. Design is Not ergonomic & will not feel comfortable.
2. Noise cancellation is very poor. Except your voice all are clear while call.
3. Sound quality is OK only. Lot of Bass is there, if you like it.
4. Over priced and NO return. Only replacement woth another one is available."
1879,5.0,"After using for more than 6 months, trying one other device at 200 bucks higher cost, bought the second one for spouse and recommended 3 to colleagues, I can safely say boAt Rockerz is the best in all aspects."
1880,5.0,Please go for it. Worth every penny. I enjoy my every workout.. Thanks to the boat rockerz. And also pairing is and so is functioning. Will update after using more time. And yeah the wire is a bit long.. Appreciated if it had been a bit short
1881,1.0,"I got this product 6 months ago and now it has stopped working. When I took it to Srinivas Telecom whose one of the replacement partners of Boat in Bangalore, they told me it’s a fake product. The product on the right is fake and the left one is the original one."
1882,4.0,"Bought these at 999/- . Decent sound and good quality. But sometime I face too much of interference while driving, couldn't know the exact reason. Anyway I suggest to buy if you are looking for some midrange headset."
1883,4.0,"Sound clarity is really awesome feels like theatre effect however it does only 50% noise cancellation for the calls which is ok for 1500 rupees headset. Overall good for sound, however noise cancellation needs improvement"
1884,5.0,"Product was ok but not so good only bass was good.after use of 5 days I found that the earphone voice was not working in some apps & earbuds is in bad condition, battery backup was not good.i can used only 3 hr in my fully charged wireless bluetooth."
1885,2.0,Within 2 months of regular use earphone was not functioning properly.So I ask for replacement but didn't offer the replacement instead of that they gave us repair option.They received my earphone for repairing and at the time of returning they lost my attractive ergonomics with a Comfort Fit which was Built with uncompromised craftsmanship from premium materials .
1886,4.0,"Good look, sound is good ,bass in not very high (bass is normal), no connection problem even if phone is 2 rooms away, comfortable fit, battery life is also very good.........

I'm giving 4 stars only because this can't be used while playing games due to audio latency.

It is very good wireless earphone compared to others."
1887,4.0,"The Bluetooth connection gets disconnected sometimes even though the bluetooth is on & also the songs skips in between. Plz note that it doesnt skip due to a faulty player ... I Have also tried on gaana,spotify and normal music player but I still have the problem."
1888,5.0,"Bass is Unbeatable(9.5/10). It is almost comparable to Flagship Headsets. Noise Cancellation is Good(7/10). Bluetooth Connectivity is Little bit slow if you are connecting new Device for the first time but once connected it auto connects Very quickly.
Overall a better package. (8.5/10)
Under 2000 Rs. Budget must go for it!"
1889,5.0,"boAt Rockerz 255 sports Bluetooth headset is an amazing product...value for money.... Amazing sound quality,bass is just like home theater,bass lovers you must buy it..no problem with Bluetooth connectivity.Battery backup is superb.Noise cancellation quality is awesome.Perfectly fits and comfort in ears.Its better then my expectations."
1890,5.0,"Great product. Worth every buck.
Fits perfectly in ears.
Sweat resistant.
Music and voice quality is great.
Battery life is good enough, for normal use it can easily last for couple of days.
The cable just a lil bit long, so keeps on hanging and swinging in front.
But overall a great product. Worth buying."
1891,1.0,"Very worst i would say no customer support .... and frndz 1st of all it is not even 1% swet proof.
Not working in 1 month bluetooth not connecting to my device.. better go for phillips, sony or samsung.... not worth.."
1892,3.0,"Superb bass and noise cancellation. I connected to 2 phones at a time, it’s an amazing bluetooth feature. Very comfort to handle and can easily track switches. The only issue is the built quality! It can be more better I think."
1893,5.0,"Great quality earphones with good ear supports that dont let them fall off. Bluetooth connection so good that it catches signal even from two walls behind it. Sound quality is great and constantly giving 6 + hours of play time. Go for them , best for this price"
1894,3.0,"Okayish product. Good sound with bass, but if you are on normal call it will catch a lot of background noise around you. For example, if there is a TV playing in another room, it will catch that sound too and the other person in your call will get lot of disturbances. Other than this, it's a good product."
1895,3.0,"This product has the good sound quality...but if you're looking forward to use this product in gym,then this is the worst because of the range. You can't even go 4 to 6 feet away from your mobile.. Even though this is a Bluetooth headphones but still while working out you will have to keep your phone in your pocket..."
1896,1.0,"Sound quality is ok ok, but the battery drains out in 15 mins and takes around 2 to 3 hrs to charge, i purchased this in april since i purchased this i am not happy and the when i tried to return the product I don’t have option to do it, i can only replace it which is the worst part of this product and Amazon service. Very disappointed with the product and Amazon."
1897,3.0,"It's good

Good battery life 5-6 hrs at medium volume
Good design & it's not hurting ears

Fast connection

Cons

3d,8d sounds not clear or this earplugs don't have these effects

Hard press button ( not so hard but also not so soft)

You can purchase it, if you don't want to use it professionally."
1898,4.0,Good product with good connectivity and sounds best if u use at 80% volume u can experience a good feel around neck dose not feel weight too much battery backup is good it runs about 5 hrs in single charge which is sufficient for me for 2 days good product if u think u need bass u can have it
1899,4.0,"One of the best budget headphones after House of Marley and best budget Bluetooth headphones in the market right now.
If you are a bass lover then this is a good one, but you have to keep low hopes for other voice notes. Clarity is good enough. In rare cases, the mic provides low gain so other parties cannot hear you properly. Good to go with.
Cheers."
1900,2.0,I purchased it on 12th october and received on 16th october sound quality is good but today is 5th november and suddenly i found mike is not working no issues with sound quality or Bluetooth connectivity but mike is not working now they are showing 1 year replacement warranty i would like to replace my boat rockerz 255 please help me what to do please contact me
1901,4.0,There is no doubt for sound quality in boat beat at this price point in the market but there is a lot of connectivity issue and interference due to bluetooth 4.1 when using outside of the house . But boat after sales service is one of the best after sales service i have recieved which was totally hassel free for me.
1902,1.0,"Initially what seemed to be value for money has all of a sudden stopped working in just 10 days time. Have tried putting it on charge and everything else but it seems the boAt Rockerz is dead.

I would advise against buying this particular earphone of boAt. Kindly arrange for a replacement or refund whichever is earlier."
1903,1.0,"I have purchased this on 16th July 2019 and today (09th Aug 2019) its not working. Its not turning on.
No service center is available for boat wireless headphones.

Its your call if you are purchasing this. but i have bad experience at all.
In photo you can see i am pressing power button but its not turning on."
1904,4.0,"The sound quality etcs are awesome but after 7 months my right side earphone stopped working.guess wat I claimed my warranty,zero charges were applied and I got a new product from company. Great service form boat. guys no loss for your money"
1905,3.0,"One of the 2 I bought is not functioning. I need refund for this. I would like to return it.
I know boat has good reviews. But one the product is not functioning. Bluetooth connection and battery life are poor. I'm not getting battery life even for 1hour.
Kindly please help me. I don't want this product. It's been only 20days I brought"
1906,3.0,I got the in month of june.... Suddenly right side had stopped working.... Can u help me for replacement.... As itz showing 1 year replacment warrenty
1907,5.0,"Got this for just ₹ 1k and the sound quality is excellent considering this price.
The noise cancellation of these earphones is pretty good .
I was using a basic in ear style earphones and now I can feel there's so much difference in the sound quality.

'Boat rocks' 👌✌️👍"
1908,5.0,"Very nice product. This is the first time I have ordered any electronic good online and I am fully satisfied with this. Bluetooth connectivity and Sound Quality is very nice. Noice cancellation is also good. Overall a 5 star rating product. Amazon, thanks for staying on your words. What you guys show, you deliver. Thanks :)
Much love from Hyderabad, India."
1909,3.0,Don't buy this. Sound is not very excellent. It is below average. If you are looking for strong base and beats then surely no for it. Battery life is good. Moreover only one service centre in entire mumbai ( This is really weired.) That too in Malad.
1910,2.0,"It was initially performing good, but eventually after 3 months it has been identified with issues like one side earphone not working sometime , bluetooth connection issues etc. Then it totally stopped working, by advice is to go for good and reliable product rather getting attracted to boAt discounts."
1911,1.0,Its only been six months I bought this and its not working now. I am unable to recharge because it gets over heated.
1912,1.0,"This is the worst product I've ever received from Amazon. My product was working fine for the first few weeks after which I faced problem with the battery, itvis draining so fast and also it is bulged. I'm neither able to return now since the return period is over. I've purchased so many times from Amazon but this is the worst experience. Total waste of money."
1913,1.0,Voice quality is not good most of the time I face voice break and while driving it’s completely not audible. I’ve used it only 2 or 3 days after purchasing and looking for replacement but there is no option bcz it is more than 10 days old now. I purchased it as a gift for someone but not able to give him bcz of some reasons and used it myself and disappointed.
1914,3.0,"If u want music on the go then this is it, however the microphone is very very bad. I took calls indoors as well as outdoors and the other party was unable to hear me and this still continues i have to hold the microphone area and speak loud. Even i play pubg daily usinh these headphones and my teammates are not able to hear me what im talking."
1915,5.0,With this amazing price of 899 it's really a nice product. With all good features. Must buy it. But after buying use it and check if it is charging nor not . So that you can return it within the Free replacement date. I got a damaged product with charging port not functioning . So do check this . Otherwise is recommended to buy.
1916,5.0,"Best earphone with mic nice sound quality, noise cancellation best other people notice that you talk on mobile or earphone....most important hands free if your long time talker or working in office then this is best option to do multitasking.

Around my 5 friends using same product no issues 2 earphones are 6 months+ old no complaints."
1917,3.0,Writing this afer using for a month. Battery backup is only 3-4 hours which is very bad it should atleat have 7-8 hours also it does not notify for % of battery all of a sudden it starts saying low battery & in 5-10 minutes it switches off. Not expected this from BOAT.
1918,1.0,"Even though there was a good rating about the product which prompted me to buy this, the product's charging does not stand by and everytime when I use I have to charge...."
1919,5.0,"I bought it at lightening deal offer 999/- only. When I saw the review from youtubers I have made plan to buy this. Buy this product without any hesitation it is best in every terms e.g Price, Built in Quality, Sound."
1920,4.0,Since most of the new phones Bluetooth version is 4.2 and above. Boats is version is 4.1 version and calls & text announcing and interaction with phone is missing. You have to manually take call by pressing call button on device. Apart from this the sound quality is awesome.
1921,1.0,"It Got damaged within a month. None of buttons are working.
Such a poor product from boat never Exwpected

And when it comes in term of replacement which never happens. Following up with customer care of boat from last 10 days with no response."
1922,1.0,"One side of the earphone is not working... Just it's been 6months. Disappointed.
Pls don't buy this earphones, cx service ppl will redirect to connect service center and there is no pick up from the seller to replace the product. Never opt for these earphones"
1923,5.0,Hello friend I have buy this product it would be happen 1 week for me when I buy this product It unbelieveable his bass quality is awesome it playing like a 2d sound you can hear the background music clearly about the noice cancellation so it kk so I don't know in the future it will work better or not but yes u can buy it by closing your eyes
1924,4.0,"I bought this product for Rs.1000 from Amazon as it was on an offer. I must say it's such a wonderful product at this price. It's been more than 1 month now and I am using it for more than 3 hours everyday and no issues as of now. Great sound quality, good battery life, great product at this value."
1925,5.0,"I am using this for a few months and it is incredible... build quality is good, noise cancellation is better and sound quality is best.. recently i purchased samsung U Flex for 3800 but in comparison with boat I love to say that Boat rockerrz really rocks in sound quality about half price compare to samsung u flex."
1926,4.0,"if you keep up your volume high for longer timer when you are in a call then a large amount of disturbance will occur.if the volume is low then its fine. i have tested this for 5 times. remaining all is fine.good battery backup,nice sound with more base but we can adjust in our mobile equaliser, durability is good."
1927,4.0,"At this price range nice. As it's more long in the neck, for me personally, felt it should be little short in length.

Initially delivered piece has some defect and was getting some buzz sound both mic n speakers. I opted for replacement. Amazon delivered a nice piece."
1928,5.0,"These r the best Bluetooth earphones under 1000 bucks.
If u r a bass head ull love it.
I don't find such sound quality on JBL t110 Bluetooth or Samsung level u buds.
I bought these for 899 n worth every penny.
Definitely recommend these."
1929,4.0,"This product is an excellent one, very dependable, sound quality, noise cancellation, battery life is excellent! Only concern is if you lose the ear bud or ear holder... you have to buy new one which is hardly possible, they couldve given 1 or 2 spare ear buds & clip."
1930,4.0,"Been using now from 3 months very good battery backup. Its really up to the mark. No question asked. Giving me 5-6hrs use continuous. So on an average u just need to charge at night and it's good to go.

Disadvantages: Not good for music lovers, I miss the tweets and also the bass. So 1 star less for this."
1931,4.0,Too much bass effecting the sound quality. Mid and treble are nowhere balancesand has to use equilizer. Not recommended if you want to listen old Hindi songs else good for current remixes trend.
1932,2.0,I bought this on Feb 2019. Within 5 months i.e on 19 June 2019 It got damaged. Right side is not working at all. Not a reliable product I guess. They have a 1 yr warranty thankgod. But would not recommend this.
1933,1.0,"Hey guys , it's been about 3 months since I bought this thing. And one side already stopped working. I do have the warranty of 1 year but I don't know how to claim it. Authorities in charge please help me to claim my warranty. It would be really helpful. I have the proof and other documents required. Pls help me in this as soon as possible."
1934,1.0,"Worst product.
1st time buying it was a battery complaint,
So replaced then get new one. That also same product but sound quality is very very poor. It's not like boat headset.
Same brand and model but why the sound quality get's very different. Fake.
I never expected from this from amazon..
Worst experience ever.."
1935,2.0,Product was good but after just 4 months it started jittering in the left earpiece and after one month in the right. a bad side for boat i got two boat rockerz 255 in 12 months and both of them showed same results.you can buy realme or mi earphones .both earphones will give you a good experience on the prices they are available
1936,5.0,It works normal in sweat so you can use it in gym or anywhere else you want. Dont believe the ones saying it doesnt cuz they dont know how to use it properly and probably just ruined it on their own. This is the only company which has good sound quality and noise cancelling earphones n headphones for a good price.
1937,1.0,Please do not buy it .... I bought and the problem started after 15 days .. Battery is weak .. adjustable buttons skips the song on its own after playing it for 15 seconds ... You can get repair only through official site .. they repaired it thrice still problem continues such a waste .. believe me and I am not joking.... Other two pieces which my friends ordered also has the same issue
1938,4.0,The product is good with great bass the only problem is when we call someone the voice breaks & and battery drops from 20% to direct zero.One star less because of that other wise good product
1939,5.0,"Sound Quality: Insane bass
Battery life: a bit mediocre but given the price and build quality, it's cool.
Durability: I've owned boAt products before, I can vouch for it's build quality.

Verdict: Packs a helluva punch when it comes down to audio quality and fits into the wallet pretty well. A must recommend from my side. Research the product tech specs on the internet for more information."
1940,4.0,Everything is good about the product. The only drawback is bluetooth starts losing connection after 5 meters. You can't hear anything. Rest everything is well.
1941,5.0,"Reviewing after months of usage.
Pros.
1.Good sound quality.
2.sturdy.
3.good bass.
Cons.
1.battery backup is not upto mark."
1942,5.0,"great product affordable price
iam a huge fan of boat products
iam using a BOATROKERZ 510
and a BOATROKERZ 255
you guys are awesome the material quality is great"
1943,1.0,"The right ear bud stops working after 2 months. This happened twice, even the replacement had the same issue. Then it's just irritating to listen on this damn thing. Cannot be used in the gym as it keeps slipping back of your neck."
1944,4.0,"THE EARPHONES ARE REALLY GOOD
BUT THE SERVICE FROM THE BOAT IS VERY VERY POOR ONCE YOU GIVEN UNDER WARRANTY TO REPAIR IT THEY GIVE US SOME DIFFERENT EARPHONES
SO THE SERVICE FROM BOAT IS DISGUSTING"
1945,4.0,"Product built quality is good. The battery shows on 100%, 80%, low. This might be bcoz software issue. Sound is very high with bass and most of the time it hurts the ear due to high bass not for a long time use to listen the music."
1946,4.0,Only one thing is bad which is little bit long lead otherwise everything is good. I gifted this to my husband and he likes it so much. Thanx Amazon..
1947,4.0,"In this headphone, you will hardly find any loopholes. But while talking over the call on WhatsApp or on other platforms, this headphone doesn't allow Noise Cancellation of surroundings. Here, it takes back its seat from being perfect."
1948,3.0,Overall bass and the sound clarity is best in budget but after i I used it for a month the button automatically gets pressed and the tune gets changed and also volume goes down automatically without pressing anything.I have got replacement warranty so I will change it but they have only one store at Mumbai they should extend their branches.Hope u will get some info from this review.
1949,2.0,"Earlier i hav used jbl so now i am feeling it's not that much good and the major disadvantage is, for gaming its not good , experienced delay while playing pubG. For 1000 rs it's may be worth but not that much good 😢"
1950,3.0,"I have notice today and campare with the other boat headphone of the my friend
There are few differences from official site
1- the node which connect wire and solid part is not plane
2 - boat tag on headphone is in oposite direction
So i have an doubt is it a real one or fake.
I have ordered it on sale"
1951,1.0,"Battery issue started after few months, sometimes is does not work and after few months stopped working at all, useless product, don't buy at all!!"
1952,4.0,"Heavy bass.
Comfortable to wear.
Comes 100% charged.
Fast connectivity.
Magnetic buds.
Voice instruction when connected or disconnected or on/off"
1953,5.0,Aesthetically good and same performance wise...very much sufficient for an average phone and music user...good product at this affordable price..special thanks to Amazon for a great deal..
1954,3.0,"When you buy this Bluetooth earphones, Amazon/ Boat says 6 hours battery backup but its not true only 2-3 hours battery life, cause i calculated 2-3 times, I'm live in Mumbai, i was travel in Mumbai local trains daily 1½ hours to destination but when i was coming my home i daily charge, i just use when i was Traveling only.... But as per comparisons Sound quality Boat 220 is always best..."
1955,4.0,"Worth for a 1000rs far better than Boult and noise
Battery will come for 1 day for regular users ,sound quality is good but not excellent , causing pain after wearing helmet for 20 minutes but it's the same in all headsets"
1956,5.0,"Excellent quality product 👍
Mind blowing battery🔋 backup
Every penny is worth 👌
Thanks for providing this type of extraordinary product 🤝"
1957,1.0,Very poor battery. Once full charge hardly giving 60 minutes of talk time. Purpose of the head phone is failed and hard to keep it in charge continuously. Waste of money and better to go with a good wired one.
1958,3.0,"Well it’s good product for this price.

Sound clarity is good.. but not that great when compared to few others.
Battery back up : I was able to use it continuesly for 5 to 6 hrs.
You have products with even more battery back up..
but for the price.. it’s worth for daily use."

1960,1.0,"Today I receive this product , sound quality is ok , but its Bluetooth range is so poor . Poor means its worst. Worst product ever. I m surprise that how this product is in amazon's choice list."
1961,5.0,"Good headset. Value for money. Bass and music lovers best choise. 2 mobile connection with the heatsdset at the same time is really a great option.

After 9 months of use, oneside speaker was not worked. I registered a compliant in boat website. Immediately they pickup and replaced new one. Really it's awesome customer service. More than value for money. I strongly recommend this one. Love it"
1962,1.0,I bought it recently and my right ear phone not working..don't buy..can I get it exchanged as one side ear piece sound is very low..not at all satisfied...help me with the options..what to do now..
1963,5.0,I want to tell everyone I was so confused to take wirless headphones or bloothooth headphones. But now my confusion is totally cleared... One time investment Boat headphone. I want to must say BOAT headphone are very reliable and very clear sound with superb base. This is not only me talking about headphone my brother also having BOAT wire headphones and he is very satisfied... Thank u Amazon... And for one day delivery thank you so much
1964,5.0,"Best for BASS lovers. Good sound quality. 5 to 7 hr battery life. 1.20hr to 2hr time to charge from 0 to 100%. Available all functionality like pause and play, sound increase and decrease, skipping tracks both front and back, accessing Google assistant...ect. Overall best Bluetooth earphone under 1500rs. If you can buy it under 1000 it would be best deal."
1965,1.0,"Disconnects automatically.
Battery goes from 60% to 0% immediately.
Bad quality mic"
1966,4.0,"Boat earphone

Using boat earphone is good bluetooth connectivity is ok
Noise and Sound quality is superb
Valuable buy
Music means Boat

Amazon Experience
Delivery on time.
All the track information 👍"
1967,3.0,"I bought for 1399. Buy it on prime day cause it was 999. Sounds good and at such price it is worth
Cons - Power shows 100% even after use of 2hrs. When at last breath it shows 60-80% and drains in 20-30mins.
My experience is 4-5hrs of play"
1968,1.0,"One side of the earphone stopped working after 7 months. Since it was still under the warranty I had given for the repaire/replacement. Now it's been a month, there is no clue about the ear phone. Their one year replacement warranty is just a scam. Don't ever buy this product. Their customer care number is not working. No reply for emails."
1969,3.0,"Nice one at this price range (1499). Bluetooth range up to 15-18 steps, but it will disconnect if you go out off range and need to reconnect again, no auto connect. The control buttons in right side."
1970,5.0,"Product got deliver timely. Sound quality is very good when listen music or from YouTube.
Battery backup last up to 4-6hrs depending upon usage. Thanks to boat bluetooth speakers."
1971,3.0,"Not the best from boat. The headset discharges pretty quick. Otherwise it has good sound quality, and is ideal for work outs."
1972,3.0,"I've been using the product once in a while when I go out to jog and every it does a good job at holding in my ears and providing an acceptable quality of sound and novel sound cancellation with no issues of sweat

But none of that feels perfect but just enough to bear with it for a couple of hours

It's a good ""product for the price"""
1973,4.0,Great product. I buy these earphone in Amazon sale and at that time price was Rs. 999. I found these earphone working with great sound and good noise cancellation with bass itself. But the range in meters is not so good. You can use within a room itself not outside your room where your Mobile is placed connected with Bluetooth. Apart from this range all are best.
1974,5.0,Just go for it with no second thought since it has good bass and sound quality for attending calls is awesome without any noise and didn't feel bad at all after purchasing this product and it is worthy for your money.
1975,1.0,"Worst earphones i ever used. I sent them twice to garage for repair with in a month ,
left earpiece stopped working after one month of use and i sent to Mumbai for repair after 20 days i received repaired product and again after 20 days it stopped working , oh crap , dont buy its not rugged , two of my friends suffering from same problemz"
1976,1.0,The headset I received was faulty ..there is a lot of distortion in the sound and the device does get paired which is a good thing but the device since being faulty does not work constantly but has an intermittent sound ..music breaks and the sound is not constant
1977,4.0,"Have been using it daily for 6 months now. It's very easy to use, excellent music quality, very sturdy for daily and rough use. Only Con - Mic quality is below average, the person on the other end hears the noise around you more yours. Else, recommended."
1978,2.0,"The most important thing to know about this product is that, when you are listening to mucic it works ok. But when you are talking to someone, its not good at all. The other person will all the time say, I cant hear you, or speak a little louder. And also the battery backup is not good either. So look for rather something better than this."
1979,1.0,"Just stop selling bogus products in the name of brands . Me along with 3 of my friends bought a pair each of these "" high end"" earphones and we all are facing the same problem within 15 days. Out of the two earphones one has stopped working and it's the same with my friends as well. Just don't buy this product. It really isn't worth your money AT ALL !!"
1980,5.0,"Product is very good but given charging cable is defective so using mobile charging cable, Bluetooth connectivity is good but anything like your hand comes between headphone and mobile, you may feel some disturbance in connection"
1981,5.0,"Great bass and treble, best sound quality, best noise cancellation, battery backup upto 6hrs, very fast bluetooth connectivity. I was able to buy this product for Rs.999/-. After delivering the product, it was found to have received Rs.100/- in the Amazon pay balance. That means I got the boat headphone on Rs.899/-. Thank you Amazon."
1982,5.0,"Totally satisfied with the quality, its battery last for days if you use it 1-2 hrs daily and can be used for 5-6 hours continuously,
Sound quality is also good"
1983,5.0,"It is one of most selled and awesome product by boat. The base is high. Sometimes it shadows vocals. But if you are new in this price range earphones then you can't get any cons about this product. The battery life is also good. While charging in morning, u can use it whole day easily.

Must buy product if you want budget wireless earphones."
1984,1.0,It's pathetic. Mic of the headphone stopped working withing 3 weeks from the purchasing. Even the Bluetooth connectivity of the headphone is below standard level. I have requested a replacement from their official website and it's been more than 6 days and the product is not yet picked for replacement. Really disappointed.
1985,3.0,"Good design. Fits well. Bluetooth connectivity is good and receive voice notifications.
Lacks in bass and beats and sound clarity lacks."
1986,3.0,"I listened to the songs when I plugged the charging chord, i couldn't believe the awesome quality sound it gave me. I discovered fault after exactly 15 minutes of unboxing it. The battery is faulty. Only works when power chord is connected. Filed for return and replacement exactly 1 hour after reciving it. Giving only 3 stars due to faulty product. When it comes to sound quality nothing can beat this earphone."
1987,1.0,"After 20 days of use, battery life is drastically worst day after day. Also Bluetooth is not working properly. Please return and refund my amount."
1988,3.0,This one is perfect for workouts... Bluetooth connectivity is super..... But....sound output is not at all good at this price range... I got this for ₹999. That's a pretty deal.. i feel mi basic wired earphones(399₹) gives much better output than any other mid range earphones.. and main thing.. package was open when i received the item.
1989,4.0,The sound quality is amazing it is completely light weight . No doubt you will get value for you money by buying this product. Only issue is if you are buying it for answering your calls surely you will be dissatisfied because the Mike is very sensitive and catches every sound in your surroundings and you will not be able to listen what you are talking
1990,5.0,"Good quality. Good noice cancelation,good disability,order and come today hust in 2 days ..... Afterall technical things....master is good,sound quality nice ....my ph connection is 5.0 bluetooth so it good for you if you have good bluetooth version.....atlast VALUE FOR MONEY GOOD IN SOUND AND clearity od sound is good...."
1991,3.0,"Sound quality is very average. Battery backup is alright and about durability, one ear has already stopped working just after 6 months of use. I purchased Amazon prime subscription just to avail the little extra discount it had for prime members during August, 2019. Very disappointed."
1992,4.0,"Hi, I ordered boat rockerz 255 on January 2019 and now it's not working properly - some days back one side has stopped working and now it gets turn off after every 10 min. Even if it's 100% charged. I want to replace my headphones with a new one as I believe that it is still in the warranty time."
1993,5.0,Absolutely impressive!Sound quality is good.Build quality is good.It came fully charged so no need to charge it initially.Amazon packing and delivery on the dot as always!
1994,4.0,Sound quality is too good (Music & Calling) and little bit negative is battery backup and Bluetooth connectivity. I had used this for more than week. I felt battery drain quickly. Can use 3 to 3.5 hrs. Some times connectivity is interrupt while i used in jogging and it will cover very short distance. Over all it's good and worth product in price range
1995,4.0,"The sound quality is good,noise cancellation works perfectly. Bluetooth connection works fine, the wires could have been a little shorter. Battery also works fine, the only thing is when indicator is shown for low battery (20%) it drains within minutes."
1996,4.0,"Sound is amazing , build quality is good,
But the range is pretty less. If you leave your phone in the other room, connectivity is gone .

Otherwise all is good , Worth the money spent."
1997,3.0,"Too heavy on bass not at all balanced sound reproduction. Even the vocals and treble get extremely mudded with bass .I got it on sale for 999 rs,using it just for watching tv not at all ideal for music listening"
1998,4.0,"Not better than other boat products, i bought head phones earphones with mic and Bluetooth speaker from boat and this is the one which is least performer"
1999,4.0,"If your budget is around 1500 just go for it because it's worth. Sound quality is very good if you're interested to listen bass boosted songs then without any thought just buy it.
It has the best bass quality but mid-range and vocals are pretty decent. Body, design, earplugs comfort are all pretty good. So i give it four stars.⭐⭐⭐⭐"
2000,5.0,"No doubt the product is designed beautifully, with satisfied sound quality and noise cancellation.
Range is also valuable for the product."
2001,2.0,"After 10 days, after expiry of return period, this device has stopped working. Looks like it was configured to work well only for 10 days. It is taking ages to connect through Bluetooth. Whether you are trying to connect mobile or a computer. Also if connected it disconnects on its own. Not expected from such a good brand"
2002,3.0,"Comprehensive review:-
1. Noise cancellation is just pathetic, it does not work in rush area.
2. Connection breakage problem is common and I am facing the same after using this in two devices.
3. Pathetic customer service"
2003,5.0,I have been using this earphone particularly while cycling on the way to my office and it comes really handy. (I pass through a not-through-fare road on campus). May be the quality of the call is not the best but at this price range there can't be a better ask.. Go for it.
2004,2.0,"I bought these 4 months back, have good quality but already sent for replacement as one side stopped working, same with few of my friends who ordered same product and are having similar issue, and their service about replacement isnt really what one would call great , i had JBL ones though the sound quality is not that good their durability is great."
2005,3.0,"Overall build quality is good. Sound quality of earlier purchase 6 months back is much better. In this item, the Bass is good , but boomy and treble is less prominent. Battery backup is excellent. Overall sound quality is average."
2006,4.0,"liked every thing but the issue is that is that the rubber that fits in the ear ,pointed one is not available anywhere, i had lost one those and i cannot find it and i think it is compulsory as it gives a better grip specially for people like me who use helmet most of the time,you should provide that rubber at least a pair as you provide the round one"
2007,4.0,"Battery back up is the only problem, and these does not vibrate when your phone rings, so if your phone is on silent/vibration and you have not plugged in the earpiece, you will not know your phone is ringing. So ultimately these need to be in your ears all the time, which is a pain."
2008,1.0,"Earphones stopped working within in 6 months of purchasing. Service center in Hyderabad is not responding or picking my calls. There is only one service center in Hyderabad, which is in Uppal. So please refrain from buying this earphones as BoAt is not committed to customer services after sales."
2009,5.0,"The sound quality is good with sweet bass . It's not prefers for heavy or large bass people, those who wants high volume music. Noise cancellation is also very good . Even in heavy traffic or riding vehicle you will be able to communicate with each other. Material is also far better than plastic material, it has a rubber type material."
2010,5.0,"Boat is all time love...!!
But there is a problem if your are addicted to use earphones more than enough...buetooth connectivity get automatically disconnected after one or one n half n hour....!!
Overall experience is nice...!! 😌😌"
2011,5.0,Best part it charges in 40 mins but stays up to 6 hrs. Noise cancellation is average. After using for 5 months it gets struck in the middle when listening to music. And charging is the same. There is much difference in the sound which is bad and gets reduced. I don't recommend this product even its price is low.
2012,4.0,"A good headphone, but the neck piece is not rigid as shown or suggested in pic. Don't know if it'll stay intact while riding etc. Feel it's a bit costly."
2013,4.0,Sound quality is okk bass is good but don't know this shit happens to me only battery backup is not good and when showing 20% it goes in 3 minutes completely down it only last for 4-5 hours
2014,1.0,"It was used once and never charged again... Poor quality product. Charging jack is not working, tried with different chargers and cables. But it did not charge at all.. Other reviewers also confirmed that product does not has life..
Although sound quality was good when I used it"
2015,1.0,With in 2 months of use one earphone stop working ....it's having loose connection.i registered complaint about it on portal ..then pick up for faulty piece is generated & later on cancelled by them..after so much of mail pickup done ..now it's more than 10 days of pickup ..I am unable to track progress as given tracking number is invalid after pickup...
2016,5.0,Excellent product for the price below 1K. Seamless connectivity and Ok sound. Battery life also seems to be Good. Started using boat since 1Day.
2017,3.0,Call vibration alert is not there why company gives a false features on discription
2018,5.0,"Even after a year plus and with better models coming in, this is still a very good buy. Especially for bassheads like me. And the fitting is ergonomic and doesn't hurt my ear. Love it."
2019,5.0,the best wireless bluetooth headset under 3k boAt rockerz but i've got it for 999 and this is a best headset under this price tag ..... sound quality is owsome .. not any type of pain in ear very crystal clear sound i love it ... if any one wants a bluetooth headset just go for it ... and don't think about any negative comnt .... i can say that boAt rockxxx...
2020,3.0,"This product very good at this cost (more than good and less than execellant). If your budget is around 1500, then for sure this is the one you should go for. Who likes excellant sound qulaity and loves perfection then you need to spend more than 5k on a wireless headset otherwise you can get a wired earphone in just around 1000 ( JBL is an option)."
2021,5.0,All good but please make a design in your neckband like Ptron tangent pro headphone because there is no adjustment for adjust length of wire
2022,1.0,"Built quality of this product is very poor. The wire regularly gets detached from microphone box.
After use of few months only one side speaker stopped working.
Boat does not have pick up and drop facility for device after they get damaged.
My advice is to avoid this product and go for some superior brand"
2023,1.0,Bad product.disfunctioning in only 3 mnths.im very much upset.nobody should buy this product and again they are saying that i shud go to goregaon branch to replace it i live in vashi and so its very far away dis is the worst product i hv ever used.money wasted brcause of this product.i want my money return or else send someone to replace my product.
2024,1.0,This one stopped working only 2 months of light usage. The sound quality was good and convenient to use but then what's the use if doesn't even last 6 months.
2025,4.0,"It's a good earphone if your range is around 1.5k . Battery is not very good but fine. Sound is also fine.
If you can increase your budget a little then go for Tagg Inferno..they are the best earphones available in the market under 2.5k."
2026,2.0,Build quality poor. Battery Ok. If phone call comes while watching videos oscillations are heard and sound becomes inaudible and fluctuating. You will have to disconnect and reconnect to get clear audio again. Using since 15 days.
2027,2.0,Stopped working in just 2 months of usage. I use them in gym and they have stopped working. Now i cant even get them returned or changed from Amazon due to Amazon 10 day policy. I have to contact boat customer service. If u are a casual user then these are for u but for regular usage while workout i guess these are not made for that.
2028,4.0,"I'm giving 4 stars as overall because the product is all good but the packaging wasn't satisfactory. The box was bit damaged fortunately the product wasn't damaged. Sond quality is above average but the better thing in such price is IPx5 sweat resistant. Noise cancellation is good too.
So try to order this separately for better packaging service rather than adding to your cart and buying more than one product."
2029,5.0,"Best sound quality in this price range..powerful bass,and trable is balanced with bass very good bluetooth headphone from boat under 1k"
2030,2.0,"The sound quality is very good for the headphone, but when it comes to the quality of voice while on call, its definitely a failure for this BOAT Rockerz 255. The other person on the call is not at all able to hear my voice. Very much disappointed !!!"
2031,1.0,"This is good looking for external only...not an internal parts or internal working status......
Battery life is only 4 to 5 hours
Didn't fixed to neck(like Neckband)
Sound quality is average
Connectivity is not bad
Overall 1 marks given outof 5
I don't like this item......if any mistakes forgive me and Tq all.........."
2032,1.0,Worst product dont every buy. service is worse than anything my headphones stopped working after 10 days replaced from the service centre 4 tyms. every 10-15 days i need to visit service centre. and now the worst thing is service centre people are indecent fellow they dont know how to speak with customers. they take 20-30 days to replace headphones
2033,4.0,Actually I booked boat Rockerz 255 sports blue. But I received just boat Rockerz .. it doesn't work properly and Bluetooth conctivity also bad. I need boat Rockerz 255 sports blue. Now I received worest product that's why I replaced. ... In Bluetooth device mentioned just boat Rockerz only.. My Previous product mentioned boat Rockerz 255 connected.
2034,4.0,"Dislike's
1 Disturbing noise during calls
2 No noise cancellation
3 Bluetooth range max 15 to 20 meter

Like's
1 Great built quality
2 Great sound quality
3 Good bass quality
4 battery backup was also good it will take 1hour 40min to fully charged
5. You can use it for whole day or next day as well."
2035,3.0,"Lemme come directly to negative issues here :

Bluetooth connectivity - sometimes it just won't connect with my phone, or takes too much time.

Intermittent audio loss: while playing the earphones mutes itself automatically, It happens quite often and it's very annoying. Same issue after replacement. So I had to return it."
2036,4.0,I thought I would never say this.. but actually it is a great Bluetooth headphone... I have used the Samsung level headphones which was great but quite expensive... But the BOAT headphones are cheaper and has quite good quality.. I recommend the boat headphone if you are looking for a cheap and good quality headphones
2037,4.0,Sound quality is good. Build quality is also nice. Its flexible and u can twist or fold it which is not possible in most of other bluetooth earphones
2038,1.0,Not sure if this is a manufacturing defect but on calls there is a constant humming noise which makes it irritating on both sides during conversation.
2039,2.0,"Bought on June 4th. But right side earphone stopped working on December 5th. Worked only for 5 months. Truly disappointing.
Better go for a higher end earphone rather than trying to save money."
2040,4.0,"Product quality good. Packing good. But sound clarity average. Pairing and on/off all in one button, so little different to use, specifically for a non tec savvy person.
Battery life good. Charging time, average."
2041,5.0,"Pros:
1. Noise cancellation is just awesome and far better than any other high range earphone.
2. BT connectivity is quick.
3. Sound quality is really good.
4. Nice look.

Cons:
1. Mic is not so good, got many complaints.
2. Needs a little care as its probable to break if not handled properly."
2042,5.0,"A compact product by boat at this cool price point, such a good product for bass lover. Fitting is good, noise cancellation is best looking at the price, bass is awesome.

Cons are bit lengthy, low and mid tunes are not clear sometimes.

Overall is a highly recommend product to all budget bass and music lover."
2043,5.0,Perfect bass sound for the beginners who likes to love the bass quality of the sound ...best budget headphones you can satisfy ...comparing to battery backup your usage is low..it will last for 10 hours..
2044,3.0,Usually it is one of best budget Bluetooth headphones with great sound quality and bass and noise cancellation is great .But build quality is not that great . After using it for a month the right earbud stopped working . I was totally satisfied with this product but after this incident now i know that the build quality of the product is very poor.
2045,5.0,"Cons:
1.Price should be less a little bit!!
2.And it should be a little bit more comfortable also ,because my ear started paining after listening music continuously!!

Btw the product was awesome!
I'm using it continuously from 3-4 days and really its 😎 cool.
And the most awesome feature is google assistant feature!!"
2046,2.0,"I got this earphones
After few days use only one side is working.This has happened not only for mee but also my friends who bought this have came through same problem and the brand is not replacing the product and also the product is under warranty.
Pls Dont buy this earphones.
Sound quality it is good
And the bass is also good"
2047,5.0,"I go to gym wearing these earphones. Sound quality is good and they didn't stop working after a rough use in gym. Sweat and weight, they have gone through it all and still working. Adding this review after two months of use."
2048,1.0,Never puchase this one. Worse earphones ever. It will stop working after sometime. It didn't just happened to me almost 5-6 people i know faced the same thing. After that the serving is very bad. They may replace your product it will take even more than a month or sometimes they will not. There never respond to the call never pick it. I have tried more than 100 times and no response till now. I if you don't want to waste your money then never buy this one.
2049,4.0,"Considering how phone's are omitting headphone jacks. This is a great buy. From fit to sound to wearing it for longer periods of time, all goes well. Battery lasts for half a day with moderate usage."
2050,3.0,"The product is good in terms of music quality, base, treble everything is sorted but a huge drawback is

THAT THE PERSON ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CALL WILL HERE ALL THE SURROUNDING VOICES CLEARLY & TOO LOUDLY EXCEPT YOUR OWN VOICE."
2051,1.0,"To claim warranty
I want to claim warranty....
I ve issue on my wireless bluetooth headset,
It was not charging and working from last 4Days"
2052,1.0,"The earphone is average, with in 3 months my earphone can't power on. Customer service is pathetic. When u make warranty claim. Item pickup guys never come to ur house. Bunch of idiots.. Don't go for it."
2053,5.0,"This product is freakingly good. But when it comes to it's build quality it lags by a point.
Moreover every part of this product is superb when it comes to noise cancellation it almost blocks the sound near you by around 85 percent and our ear drums will not get any kind of ache totally worth buying at this kind of range price"
2054,5.0,"For 899, it's a great deal. Sound quality is good and connects with my phone instantly. Battery life is also sufficient for over a day"
2055,1.0,Product was not upto mark. Flings shown in images are just for name. You cant Jog or run with these headphone. Band weight in unbalance on one side due to Mike and Controls. Speaker will go back and from ears during jogging. Battery average 2.5 Hours Max. I will recommend Samsung Level U instead of this.
2056,4.0,"Overall a good headphone at this price point. Using for 2 months now. The built quality is good & battery life is good as well, enough for a day i.e. 7-8 hours. Sound is decent and has good noise reduction. The only problem is when I connect my phone first and then my laptop, the phone incoming call sound doesn't work. Always have to do it the other way, which fixs the issue."
2057,5.0,"Worth buying at 13-1400
High bass
Enough loudness you can expect from a BT earphone
Quality is good and my personal fav is neon color as it gives a more sporty look
Comfortable to wear while workout.
Light weight
Overall rating 8/10."
2058,1.0,"Worst product, it been just 15 days and one side is NOT working even though I took very much care on not to overcharge, not to expose to heat/moisture, neither did pulled it much.

With these super optimal condition if the product fails functioning, we should think of its quality.

I am trying to claim warranty/replacement."
2059,1.0,Not for calling purpose....the opposite end caller will hear only your surrounding noises clearer than your voice....so it's a pure 100% for music... crystal clear sound quality....just go for it if you use it only to listen music.
2060,3.0,"Liked the product but sound could be more better. Design is good as compared to other device. The only prblem I found with this product is the rubber ear fittings, chances are more that u can lost it as it automatically gets loosen. Company should give extra pair of fitting same as ear buds."
2061,5.0,"This is great product for under 1000.
Sound clarity is nice - bluetooth connectivity is good too. At this price, surely a super buy."
2062,2.0,"The sound quality is not as described on the product specifications.
I would not say not worth the price - Value for Money NO!!!"
2063,4.0,"Got it today. Writing this after using it for 2-3 hours. Bass is to too good for in ear earplugs. I am an edm guy so what i want is good bass and loud music , boat rockerz fulfills it no doubt !! Noise cancellation is good ! Supports voice assistant ! Just go for it ! I am satisfied with the quality of sound, the beats everything! !"
2064,1.0,"Picture is not appropriate as per the product.
This product doesn't qualify the return/refund policy. Product seems a bit expensive.
We may feel some pain for long time usages."
2065,4.0,This product has amazing sound quality and fulfilling my all requirements and do satisfied... Go for it if you are bass lover or clear sound u want...
2066,5.0,It’s really awesome. It’s more than expectation in this price. Very cheap rate & I suggest personally you can buy it. You won’t feel wrong with your decision.
2067,5.0,"This product is good. Excellent noise cancellation, bluetooth connectivity. Sound quality differs a bit from the oringinal earphones that you get along with phone but i believe it's with all the headsets that you purchase. Battery life is good. Light weight and handy. Look wise also very attractive. You can invest in this product."
2068,1.0,DOA - Dead on Arrival. Doesn't turn on / Doesn't charge as well. I don't know if I am the only one facing this. Returned on the same day.
2069,1.0,"While playing game there is 1 second delay in the audio.
Latency of 1 second while playing game"
2070,5.0,"Excellent product. I used scullcandy. But boat dominated it by sound quality. bass is excellent. If you love bass.... Dont hesitate.
But... If adjustble is there, it would be little more comfortable. Due to lngth, it oscilates on our stomach."
2071,4.0,"Was interested because I bought their sound bar which was sensational. However, I'm quite disappointed with the sound quality. It lacks bass.

That being said, if my expectations weren't that high based on my previous experience, it would be a decent choice."
2072,3.0,"good product and sound quality but this has just decent battery power though not bad and the headset is comfortable, and noise cancellation is reasonably good.... overall worth the price for sure"
2073,4.0,"I have used this 3-4 hours only. Sound quality is impressive. Bass is superb. The Irritating thing is it beeps when you scroll feeds or pages in Iphone.
Quality is nice. In the Box: Earphone, Charging Cable, Extra Buds, Warranty Card, and User Manual."
2074,1.0,"The product was working fine when i bought it 2 months back but after 2months, one of the earphone stopped working and the microphone quality was worst from the time i bought.
Nothing is heard properly when we speak from our end in calls.
It's purely waste of money and there is no even proper support from amazon regarding warranty claim"
2075,1.0,"The Sound quality is great but it stopped working after 2 months one the is not working. It has no physical damage it just stopped working. I have face this same issue with my previous boat basehead225 2 times, but i thought Bluetooth wont be haviing any issue. very disappointed"
2076,2.0,"Expected a better product in this price range by popular brand like boat, but i got disappointment as the sound is very low bass is good but vocals are dull. The buds wires are very lengthy and it hangs below the chest and look odd. Wont suggest this product"
2077,3.0,"Good quality headphone for Music only. Not recommended for Calling.
Noise Cancellation can be improved.
While talking via headphones, the other person can hear everything in the surrounding,
except for the one whom he/she has talked."
2078,4.0,"Good sound quality with mast bass. Mic is also good, voice is super clear on the other side. Battery is also good, mine stands for 3 days since I use a little less. Comes with Ear plugs of variant sizes to smooth fit your ear without pain during long term use. Very good product."
2079,4.0,We should speak louder whenever roaming in streets... Call Receiving person cannot hear my voice clearly even am walking... But quality and bass is mass. One day it slipped from my hear while am driving. Then it was hitted by auto. Then I took it again using it.. Still the quality of sound not changed.
2080,4.0,"#Good but the loop gets expanded after usage.
#The loop should be made little tough
#Sound quality is too good and more than expected
#The rubber is the main part and holds tight in the ear but quality is not good
#A spare loop or hook should have provided like in ear 3 different buds are given"
2081,1.0,I used for 7 days then returned because its not works more than 3+ meter distance. I bought replacement also but found same quality.
2082,5.0,"Boat really rockzzzz, stunning boss beat, am music lover its perfectly fit to me,call quality also fine, battery backup also good 5hours surely..."
2083,2.0,"Don't buy this if you are addicted to music. I got it for Rs 999 but still I don't like it
These earphones do have heavy and boomy bass with excellent noise cancellation but you will not able to notice low vocal in earphones & it's music quality is not too good it don't click the mind"
2084,5.0,"This is great to listen to music and similar stuff.. But you can't use it for calls as there is no Noise cancellation and the other person can hear background voices better than you. But since I bought it for listening to music while traveling, this was a good buy."
2085,5.0,"Very good sound quality , very nice product
Must buy , easy on ears, bluetooth connect liittle problem while doing cycling and keeping mobile in pocket,
Rest all is good."
2086,3.0,Lets see noise cancelation is not actually great sound quality is okay. Battery power is also 3 star gud mic not actually high so other person might complain ones or so. But in this price its kinda gud
2087,1.0,"Its a very bad product...no noise cancellation at all...
Also battery performance is poor.
Also it is not showing accurate battery status... 100% then after few hours 80% and then direct battery low. And powered off within 1 minutes after battery low message. It is not showing battery status at 70% and below."
2088,2.0,Just few minutes ago it has reached in my house (8/92019 at 2:30pm) and i have opened this slowly and very gentle then i saw the wire is cutted ...and there is scratches ...then i have applied for return policy so again i have ordered this...hope this time getting much better ...hope for the best...and looking forward it too...
2089,3.0,"Product I really like it. One and half month back one side is not working. It's under warranty, so they are ready to replace. But until now my replacement product not got. Many times talk to customercare they telling product is out of stock sending tomorrow, day after.....now they not picking the phone also, I don't no when I get my replacement."
2090,4.0,"sound quality: Excellent compare than wired headset
Bass: Awesome
I got this product offer 1000 ...really amazing
Don't confuse with any one model ... this product 100% assurance good bass and sound quality
good material.. but hear lock buds not fit for all.. but that's not problem.. if you no need , you can remove possible"
2091,2.0,"After 10daya it's stoped to working, we brought 5 nos, and 3 nos not working, after 10 to 20days one ear phone volume damaging for all"
2092,5.0,I purchased it for my employee(electrician). Now he is looking like lord Siva with snake like headset at all times except while sleep.
2093,4.0,"Best bluetooth device like- best earphone build quality, sound quality is superb, comfortable for hang on neck but battery backup is not good👎

Nd specially for seller please add in product description -- ""extra ear tips available in boat rockerz 255 box"" cz it's a helpful for all customers"
2094,1.0,One Star is for incorrect advertising for sports! It works but its of no use for running! The hard ends bounce on your collar bone and extremely uncomfortable. You may use it for training or walking but definitely a no-no for any intensity sport. its replaceable and not returnable so be very sure before you buy it.
2095,5.0,"Excellent product in terms of usability, easy pairing, lightweight and great noise cancellation. Longer battery standby time is also very helpful. Sound quality is nice, all tones are equally heard, no distortions."
2096,3.0,"Expected to be good one, some how like china product after usage of few days right side valuem having problem.
not rally great."
2097,5.0,Love it nd the bulid nd sound quality is far better than than the other valuables bluetooh earphones. .... I already won a Bluetooth of bose nd the comparison of bose nd boat where same sound feedback . .... Nd i used this continued from the day i charged it nd its long lasted max to max 4 days . ...
2098,4.0,"This is my first time using a wireless earphone and I tell you I'm impressed with Boat. From the super bass to the controls and battery, worth every penny. Just one downside, I think the indicator is not very much visible and sometimes have to strain to see if the charging is full or not."
2099,5.0,This is one of the best Bluetooth headphones that I have used. Have been using this for the past 10 days. The sound quality is excellent. The neck band is flexible so its much easier to handle. Overall its a very good value for the money you pay.
2100,4.0,"I bought the product during Amazon sale the product is good. It's durable the sound quality is also good , if you are serious sound/music lover then you can check other options but personally this is all I wanted for my workout."

2102,5.0,"The product is super.Comes with hard bass.Treble is also good. Good for workout as it doesn't get off your ears easily,the magnet gets seperated sometime while running but thats fine though.total value for purchase."
2103,4.0,Only what i disliked is the mic performance. It is totally a different sound of a person can be heard by the receiver. Its totally annoying
2104,5.0,Awesome product but battery not showing exact percentage. Mind blowing battery backup is more than 8 hours medium volume . Sound is awesome .... go for it without thinking. One thing is when volume is very low this increases volume enough ..so must do something to reduce volume at low .thanku so much .i have purchase for 899 rupee with 100 cashback.
2105,4.0,This headphone is a good quality headphone and it's Bass is also good. Wires connnected to the speakers are thin and could be little thicker.

2107,4.0,"I have been using d product for a week V Good call quality , too heavy bass , can be corrected through equaliser of music player if u don't like too much bass like me. One side of wire gets visible due to its outer layer doesn't fit the plastic perfectly .. i have used celotape to cover an fix it ."
2108,5.0,Very good battery backup. Can use while driving and the person in the other side can hear you without any disturbance. But when used in crowdy places there are disturbance to the listener. Should have avoided the voice during connectivity. Terrific base effect. Good for and comfortable. Worth buying.
2109,4.0,"A very good product in bluetooth headsets segment. Amazing sound quality, good balance of the weight.
The bluetooth is good and can stay connected for a distance about 10 meters without wall, 3 meters with wall obstruction."
2110,3.0,Sound quality is average and not that great for high volume. Battery life is average. It keeps falling off my ear even though i have tried different sizes of ear buds.
2111,4.0,Products was awesome..... Sound quality and everything was perfect but after one month its one side stops and when i claim warranty they took a month to replace it...... this was so disappointing. And also there is no actual replacement of the product they only repair it and send the same product to the costumer
2112,1.0,This ear phone is not good i purchased in Mar 19 & with in 5 months right side ear phone are not working unnecessarily I paid Rs 1800/- for this ear phones this is also just like China products. Also last 15days I have follow up for new ear phone which still not get even not update me when I get this.
2113,4.0,"Sound quality 4.5/5)- pretty good with good amount of bass.
Durability (4/5)- the material seems durable and the earphones are light weight
Battery life (4/5)- It has a decent battery life of upto 5-6 hours playtime on 80% volume.
Connectivity (4.5/5)- gets connected with seconds
Call quality (4/5)- call quality is decent"
2114,2.0,"I bought this is in may month and was very happy about this product and referred this to other friend as well but after 6 months of usage there is a problem, right side of the ear phone is not working have raided a complaint to boats team for warranty so if ur looking for long term usage think twice before you buy this product"
2115,4.0,"Pros :
● good price point
●Built quality
●Battery back up
●Bass
●Easy to use

Cons

●I'm having bluetooth connectivity issues at sometimes
●Poor call quality

I would rate 3 out of 5.

There are few alternative option for this like real me and mi neck bands."
2116,3.0,"I received my order today everythung went well till I used youtube.It doesn't play well while watching youtube videos.It keeps on stopping for a second and thats very irritating.
I bought it after reading some good reviews about the product but didn't expect this would happen to me."
2117,4.0,First thing the outer packaging was good but the box inside was tempered from back side and the headphone MIC is not working. The headphone is good with great sound and bass.
2118,3.0,Not that good bcz battery gets low very soon and Bluetooth range is not good...phone has to be too much nearby so at last you have to carry phone in every room with you while working. Vol. is good!
2119,5.0,"Very nice product at 899 price sound quality is good battery backup is also good ...
but one small problem when battery percentage showing 💯 after using 6hours 80 % showing then after using 2hours automatically battery shutdown..
one small problem but battery backup is good 👍😁😊"
2120,4.0,"I Purchased First time In 2018 At 1499
Now Again Purchase(899) Because I aise this Product From Last One Year I am Satisfied..
So Again Purchase This Product..
Sound Clarity Good
Battery Backup Is v good
Connecting is Also good
Build Quality Also good I feel It is Strong.."
2121,4.0,Its been almost 3 months and its working perfectly fine. The only problem is that it doesn't get along with whatsaap specially video call. When the Bluetooth is connected to the phone and video call is on you will find disturbance in the call and the screen shows reconnecting
2122,5.0,"Absolute Rock Star! No problem in paring with any phones, tried with iphone,samsung and pixel2. Work flawlessly. Great sound and bass effect. Great noise cancellation. Overall a 5 star product."
2123,5.0,Bass is not the best what you expect but is ok for light to moderate users. Noise cancellation is the best and easily adjustable and can be worn for 3 to 4 hours without any pain in ears. The battery suppot is also very good i don't use them for long durations at 1 time but it doesn't drain out even on loud sound quickly like other earphones
2124,4.0,"Bass is good but everything else is average....build quality is good , connectivity is good enough for 15 to 20 feet range...got it for 999 so its good"
2125,1.0,"I bouught it after reading the reviews. But, Worst earphone I have used ever. My ears start paining after just 2mint of use. Comfort level is poorest of poor. Not expected. Comes out easily from ears."
2126,4.0,"I purchased this on 23rd Jan19 and was fully satisfied by this product. However since 14th Feb, some weird sounds started to come during call. It's irritating and can not do anything. Replacement days are gone and dont know what to do. I should have gone for JBL paying small difference. Its on luck i guess......"
2127,1.0,Worst bluetooth headphones ever. The mic doesn't work and the earphone discharges very quickly. Amazon denied return and refund even within 1 day of delivery. Sound quality is bad and the cable is of poor build quality. Not expected from a product of this price.Please don't buy and invest on JBL product for better experience.
2128,2.0,"Product was good but within few days right side of earbud didn't work, and since more than month I have send it to boat warranty services centre but still not get back."
2129,5.0,"Thanks amazon to fulifll my cart
Its a very good Bluetooth headphones
Go guys n buy..you will never regret
I bought in amazon sale with 10 percent cashback 900 rs"
2130,3.0,"Good product and make me wire free. What make me worry is it's long hour duration.
So after 60% it's battery goes down like market crashed. Might be it's their technical problem which they hide or not aware of it.

I am giving review after using it last 1month"
2131,5.0,Amazing product for its price but can be improved... The sound is nice all trebles bass mids are good but you may slightly feel uncomfortable after a long wear of 3 to 4 hours for short duration no issue.. can buy this product a nice one 👍🏻💯
2132,4.0,"Not for heavy bass heads, but yes a decent sound delivery......
Battery life could have been a lil better however its not that bad
Durability is something that i just love this device for.......
Kudos to boat team, i won't comment on sound quality but again the sturdy hulk alike built quality durability at its best.
Over all a great product ..... 😉 😊 😊"
2133,1.0,"It has a loud sound, that's it... No bass no trebble nor noise cancellation... Wires are unnecessarily long for a Bluetooth headphones... Useless item that can't be return... I desperately want to return the item as I don't want to keep it.. I bought it yesterday...
Better option is SONY WC100"
2134,4.0,the earphone voice quality is good .. but i find the length of chord a bit long .. reaches way below your neck ... and the ear plugs are little difficult to put inside ear .. when loosely put inside ears it has a tendency to slip from years .. and hard push inside ear feels a little uncomfortable..
2135,5.0,Bought it in sale for ₹1099. Much more worth than its price. The bass is real good and so is the battery life.. it charges too quickly and it connects fast too.. It can connect two devices simultaneously and its a great deal for such minimal price.. Also the delivery happened within one day so yeah a review from a happy customer😊
2136,1.0,"Plz plzz frnd do not buy boat Head phone on Amazon Amazon sell boat it's fake this is not original if you going any mobile accessories.shop and comper both produt i will see lots of different
First the bird quality
Sound quality
Nake band size width and leanth
Amazon such a cheats all amezon customer
Plz don't buy"
2137,2.0,"Mat start for 2 months, it worked with high quality of sound , then my right side sound one day suddenly went off...I can negligibly hear any sound . This was followed by left earpiece. Now I can hear more surround noise then the sound of music or video. To note it's only been 3 months since I have purchased."
2138,4.0,It's overall a really nice earphone... A little expensive but.. It's boat... A brand we can all trust. One problem is that it's part the curved part which stabilises the earphone to the ear becomes loose and sometimes comes off too. Mine lt piece came off and I lost it without even realising it for a whole day.
2139,5.0,"I have been using rough and tough from past 2 days. Surprised with the battery back up. I used it with my iPhone 6S and macbook pro. Had issues connecting with macbook pro, but eventually thanks to Google. Bluetooth connectivity is a little bit of concern. But overall a thumbs up for the money i have put it on."
2140,4.0,Sound quality and Bluetooth connectivity is very good...sad part is they don't have noise cancellation...u r charge last for 4 to 5 hours
2141,4.0,Presented to my friend and it’s very handy and comfort to use..connectivity is good and proper..good for ears and nice one ..enjoying music to next level ..thanks for this product ..
2142,2.0,"Bought this headphone on 3rd oct,19....
Sound quality was awesome.. no complaint regarding the sound quality..
Bt the headphone which I received tht was damaged.... Mic wasn't working at all...
Really unhappy... U jst ruined my mood...
It was my brthday gift man...."
2143,4.0,One of the best Neckband Bluetooth earphone If you get it under 1000. And it's exclusively for Base Lovers. I didn't see any other special things on it. See my review on my youtube Chanel - Deepak J Bhasi
2144,4.0,"Good product, but high volume range is low, means sometimes when you need high volume then you cannot increase much. Better to go with rockerz 261"
2145,4.0,Good bass but low on treble. Sometimes there is some fizzy noise which comes. Battery can last up to 5 hrs of continuous playback
2146,5.0,I like the headset with bass.. And this is a perfect headset for that.. Even the noise cancelation is good.. Only problem I feel is that the mic is available little bit away from the mouth.. So the voice is not that clear during calls
2147,5.0,i have been using the same for almost 2 weeks now..and its amazing ..u get notified of everything via audio .. battery capacity is great. .
2148,5.0,"Noise cancelation doesn't work.
If you're not comfortable of the neck holder then don't go for this

Boat gives good bass to in 80% volume you can feel wow feeling"
2149,4.0,"Overal product is good ,and sound clarity okay but not very clear its mixing bass so clarity will be reducing...and not for gaming purpose"
2150,4.0,Everything was good but suddenly after two months device doesn't get start by pushing the power button searching for service center.
2151,5.0,"Sound quality is nice, battery also is good but need to improve range for connectivity. The product is awesome and is really good earphone with bluetooth in this range."
2152,1.0,I suggest never bug this product. I have seen many people who have shared with me the same kind d of problems which they faced while using g boat products. Also even if you register a complaint your product will be picked by the company but you won't get update on what is happening with the product. Sometimes the audio is breaks while song is played. otherwise it is a good product
2153,1.0,"don't buy this product, don't waste ur time to searching this product and don't waste ur money on spendineg in this product.2 months back i purchased this headset one month it is working after one month while charging it's tooo much heated n it's not working. the boat customer care number is also not working.they didn't respond to anyway"
2154,5.0,"I got it for 999 and it's worth the price, sound quality is the best I could find at this price and I'm in love with this product. Other than not showing the battery percentage, although it starts the warning for low battery 4 - 5 times before running out of it. Highly recommended."
2155,1.0,"1.Ears are totally blocked,got ear pain after 10 minutes of usage
2.music is filtered in a weird way,high bass is disturbing ..all other sounds in the song make you feel, they are coming from a tunnel.
3.I tried with different (3)ear buds given,none of them are comfortable. very bad experience while listening to favorite songs"
2156,1.0,"Very Bad and worst performance
It works only 4-6 months after that 100 % Pakka fail...
After that no communication of customer care service... No response... Waste of money..... Please choose another brand... Except BOAT"
2157,5.0,"Its sound is good, earbuds are very comfortable even wearing it for long time.
Connectivity is superfast as soon as you switch on device and switch on the mobile's bluetooth if it is paired earlier it immediately connects to it."
2158,3.0,"This is a average product . you will get better sound, battery life and small footprint on Artis BE301 with in same price range. I have purchased both of them and quite enjoying using Artis 301."
2159,4.0,"Earphones are good, bass is very high, you have to adjust the bass with equalizer if your phone supports. Else keep volume at 70% , sound quality is much better than Samsung level u.
I received a package which was replaced as the seal on the box was open. Didn't expected Amazon will do this."
2160,5.0,This product is awesome...The sound quality is terrific and it fits properly with the ear. Noise cancellation is brilliant...Just if u go on using without any stoppage it will discharge at 6 hrs that the only con so what u charge it again...A top rated product..
2161,2.0,Not using due to poor quality of sound reproduction - not sure if it's the issue with this pair or the model in general. Cheaper wired earphones have significantly better quality of music output. Disappointing. No issues with the earlier purchased boAt products.
2162,4.0,"Overall a Good Bluetooth Earphone. Battery backup is good enough last around 6-8 hrs. Only thing that bothers me is the Low charge notification and that the percentage of charge only shows 100, 80, 60, 40 & 20. Should be good if the indication is More realistic."
2163,4.0,Sound quality is much good than expected. But the neck band is flexible and ear buds are little bit heavy that's why it falls down again and again from ears. And neckband don't have vibrator.
2164,5.0,The sound quality has been more than what I expected. Overall an excellent product at an attractive price tag.
2165,2.0,I have completed a year almost that headphones. I was not used that too much pinky travelling time. I have completed a year in last jan. Now one side earphone is not working. Try something else. These are working for only one year. I have tried two three times. But if the thing will be worked only one year then not worthy.
2166,5.0,Wow. I already used boat 225 wire headset.now I purchased 999/- bass and sound quality very clear. Charge upto 10 hours.I received 3 days.i love this headphone. My friends told me. this headphone after hearing 3 months one side issue. I faced same issue. I have to replace that product.one year manufacturer warranty.but very very worth product
2167,1.0,"I was impressed with the quality products by boat. I ordered handsfree, bluetooth speaker, car charger, data cables and many others. Now this time i purchased bluetooh handsfree. But after few month one side speaker not working and battery draining like anything. Very disappointed with the quality and product."
2168,5.0,Working smooth. Connect quickly. 999 Rs is a good deal. Sound quality is also good. Remove that extra attachment with ear pods. That hurts if u use this headset for long time. It's removable.
2169,2.0,"Hello,
Kusum this side.I bought two sets of this product but unfortunately one is working well But another one Bluetooth iheadset is not working well, please change it.its only one month .I am not happy with the product. kindly repair it or replace it. It's sounds weird and it's completely uncomfortable."
2170,5.0,Good product. Only drawback is bluetooth connectivity. If I am in living room and my mobile is in bed room then the connection is lost. Otherwise good product
2171,1.0,"After using 6 months ..i am giving this review..left side hear phone is not working.....when i am trying with warranty... sending 30 KM range servicing center (even though my friend also got same problem...over all my rating for 6 months is 5/5 ,But after 6 months my rating is '0')"
2172,1.0,This one does not work after few uses. I got exchanged and the new one also stopped working abruptly. Bass is good but what’s the use id you only get to use for less than 15 days.. very disappointing. I think it’s better to she’ll out more money and buy from company that is reliable.
2173,4.0,"I got it for 800 bucks and according to the price it's worth buying... Connectivity is good... bluetooth range is okay...Sound is good... and good for calling as well.
Just 1 point I would like to highlight...It is not very much comfortable for long calls... Using it for 1-2 hrs in a day is good else you may feel pain in the ear..."
2174,1.0,It has been just over a month i bought this and it already doesn't work properly...i have hardly used it and the volume has gone down..the power on and power off voice notes have disappeared...i am not even able to return ot or exchange it anymore...this is so bad...such a waste of my money...or they have just given a duplicate product.
2175,4.0,"Very good headphones at this price, and simple to use with iPhone. The ear plugs remain in place while running. Only issue is I couldn’t find option to connect to multiple devices."
2176,5.0,"This product is pure value for money with good noise reduction and good battery life , the sound is pretty good specially bass is good , built quality is as good as jbl or sony etc"
2177,3.0,"I like everything about this earphone, superior build quality, top class sound quality, but the only complain I have is that while taking a call using this earphone, people on the other side tend to hear more of the noise in the background than my voice. This is the only issue. Rest all is good."
2178,1.0,"I bought it with lot of expectations, but it failed miserably.
My main use was to talk on it while driving
But person on another call could not hear my voice properly.

And even while playing music, sound buffers even from shortest distance from mobile.

So my experience is very bad for this."
2179,3.0,"I purchased this product 2 months before already left ear pods are not working , I feel for iPhone it is not the best option to buy."
2180,4.0,"All over a good product at a excellent price range. Battery back up really good and Sound quality too.

I have a concern not with this product but with this brand is that its service way too slow as its service center not available directly."
2181,2.0,"The magnet feature not working from day 1.
I didnt knew about the pause feature but after reading the manual,i get to know that the song gets paused when the two magnets get connected.
But this feature is not working from day one.which is very dissapointing,other than that, everything else is fine."
2182,1.0,"This is worst .. Amazon is delivering fake products these days .. I have got a fake piece and it has started showing its color, connectivity has gone worse ,music quality can not be poorer .. This is pathetic.. I would be taking this to customer forum .. And the best part is that I can't return it back now."
2183,1.0,"Worst product. One side stopped working within very few days.
Warranty also cannot be claimed.

Don't buy... Waste of money."
2184,2.0,"The sound quality is not too great, bass is poor
WHile using it to call people, it catches too much of noise from the surrounding making it almost useless to talk.
Good part about it is the build which seems sturdy"
2185,1.0,"Stopped working after 2 months, but I got replacement unit that too stopped working. Worst. Feeling cheated. Buy sony or boult audio."
2186,1.0,"The usb charging point was damaged. Requested replacement let see hows the replacement.

It has problem with the bud it doesn't hold up properly in ear.

And if the battery goes below 20% it doesnt latch up to the device"
2187,2.0,"Amazing,Best earphone I have used so far .
I got it what I want...really superb.those who are planning to go for it.
1.Good sound with extra bass
2.Good quality with cleared sound.
3.with nice looks
4.for bass lovers this is a thumbs up
5.super very nice design..."
2188,2.0,The product went dead within a month. I placed a replacement request and the product was immediately picked up. But then it took month and a half for them to replace the product. Overall not an experience that one would associate with a good brand. From now I am staying away from BOAT for sure.
2189,5.0,"Got for RS.999 on sale. Sound quality is awesome. Best part I like other than sound is battery charges quickly, then the buttons are separate so we need not search and press like struggling with single button in realme Bluetooth. Under 1500 this boat headset is the best."
2190,1.0,To me this headset is worthless. Simple reason that the basic noise cancellation is absent and one can't use these to talk. The other person would complain or hear more of background noise than my own. If a product ignores such a basic feature means its not worth a penny
2191,4.0," Value for money.
Sufficient battery backup for a day.
However, the wireless range is comparatively very short."
2192,2.0,"The sound quality is good, however the runtime is not much as compared to other earphones in the same price category. Thebattery drops from 60% to 20% in less than 15 minutes.

Also, they are not delivered in an appropriate manner. I received the product with the box in a distorted condition and the charging cover of the earphones a bit torn and twisted."
2193,3.0,"I have purched Boat Rockers bluetooth headset on July 2019, looks good in build quality, but it stops working now. There is physical tampering or crushing . three days before leftside Ear phone stopped and today right side also stopped working. I have used very carefully this headphone. Really disappointed. Not recommending to anyone."
2194,5.0,This is best for bass lovers battery backup is good light in weight overall i give five star but the packing was not good at the time of delivery
2195,3.0,I really hate over the ear headphones (too clunky to carry around) these are very good cure for those. Easy to use and like the power on/off sound.
2196,5.0,"Pros:
• Very good battery life
• Noise cancellation is good
• Sound Quality is excellent

Cons:
• It pains in the ear if used above 1 hour or so"
2197,2.0,"Does not update battery percentage status .it is still showing 100% after 6hrs of use.
Sound quality is worse than Sanhessier ..Earphone for rs.700/+"
2198,5.0,Excellent for music.. But when playing PUBG.. There is some lag.. Not for PUBG...
2199,3.0,"The product should be made more durable its just a month i been using it and its body is broken(charging slot cover ) and as it comes under pyhsical damage they are even not gonna repair it .
i paid a handfull amount of money for a showpiece i guess cause now that earphones are resting in my wardrobe"
2200,5.0,"Excellent built quality.
Flexible band.
Good battery life.
Thumping base.
Noise cancellation is also good."
2201,1.0,It has been 3 months using the product and what I find out is that one of the ear piece speaker stopped working and when I tried to contact customer service the number was invalid. So I request everyone to not buy this filthy product.
2202,4.0,"Ah the thing is, i bought this earphones for morning running but you still need to develop it. It fits good when you are walking but while running mostly it doesnt keep balance and fell off. Do more design like samsung level U earphones where weight is added so they wont fell off and some need some fitting arangement in shape to fit properly in ear."
2203,4.0,"Sound quality Awesome, Battery life is very good but auto connection problem we have to connect manually otherwise no problem at all. If you want to buy then you can buy it."
2204,3.0,Good for the price. Battery life indicator is incorrect. Doesn't auto connect most of the times after switching on. But sound quality is good. Comfortable to wear.
2205,2.0,"Though the sound and battery life is worth buying this product, in one months time the left earplug stopped working without any reason. There was no rough handling neither any connection to water, while listening to the music I realized that there is no sound from left speaker and I dont know what to do or where to go for servicing/checking. So guys, if you wish to buy, rethink and then spend."
2206,4.0,Sound quality (both media and voice calls) is okay. At this price you cannot expect hifi quality. For average user it is good.
2207,1.0,"The earphones worked okay for the first 1-2 days after delivery and then all of a sudden wont switch on. I doubt the product can get repaired either. During the time I used, the battery died twice (in less than 2 days without heavy use). Waste of 1k on a low quality product listed on amazon. Avoid buying on all means!"
2208,5.0,"Fits perfectly into ears. Loud and thumping bass. Dual pairing supported. Magnetic lock is good. Will give some troubles when searching for the devices. But looking at the price, sure buy."
2209,1.0,"Please suggest all no purchase this product .
I am buying and mourning these people are not even returning.
Poor quality,Bluetooth connectivity low ,bed product."
2210,2.0,Providing good sound quality reality of noice cancellation till i have used battery so bad to using 2 days its not working good charge decreasing to 0% in 20 minutes approx i have to replace it hope again amazon provide a good product
2211,3.0,"I bought this product 7-8 months ago. The right earphone is not working. The sound in the right earphone keeps on breaking and suddenly goes off completely. At first it functioned really well and I was very happy with the purchase but I suddenly started facing this issue from last 3-4 days.
What should be done now? Kindly help."
2212,4.0,Great product at this range.I bought this product at 999 in sale.battery backup is so good it works about 8hr when full charged.best part is that wire is tangle which makes its different and best than others.i use jbl but sound is good as compared to jbl.
2213,4.0,"Sound and bass is very good

but i very disappointed 😞 with the quality of calling sound
every time receivers complain me about the sound quality, voice sound come less and surrounding voice, No noise reduction and calling voice is very less"
2214,1.0,Replacing this product is also very hard task boat costumer care never answer your call it has be 10 days that i have raise my complaint to them the taked my earphone but know the are not share the time when it will be delivered to me and again i brought this product 4 months ago and within 4 months this product is not working at all.
2215,4.0,"I got these earphones about a month ago, and after using them for a month now I can say that I m pretty much satisfied by their performance, battery is decent last about 5 6 hours on full charge, sound is really good it works really well on high end it's just bit unclear when it comes to low ends, so overall a good product in the price range they come in"
2216,3.0,"Headphone Bass quality is fine
Good Battery life.

Incoming and outgoing call quality is not up to the mark. Other person keeps complaining about voice.
You may experience Pain in ear or head due the conical buds
When i compared with colored variant, I find cords of black headphone is tinnier."
2217,4.0,"Previously I buy boat 225 wired earphones That's awesome..but this wireless earphones is very low sound and very low Bass.

Noise cancelling is average

Bluetooth connectivity coverage low area..
Even my home theater cover more area..compare this earphone"
2218,4.0,"Nice earphone with good bass.
Sound Quality is Also good.
Sometime there is a connectivity issue or a lag but I don't know it is due to this earphone or my phone.
Overall it's a nice product but not upto my expectations.
P.S.- may be I got high expectations 😉"
2219,4.0,Headsets are good as i am using them from past 3-4 months The only problem is that you have to keep phone in your hand always as when i even go to other room it get disconnected
2220,2.0,"Product is just ok. Drawbacks: 1. Back up for only 2.5 hours only. Tested even it was just bought. Now after 3 months of usage coming to 2.15 hrs approximately. 2. The neck piece of the set is so thick and the length of wire is long then the need ,which overall looks not handy and flexible."
2221,2.0,"I bought this product initially it was good and recommended to many of my friends. Suddenly after about 4 months one side of the earpiece got repaired. Atleast 3 of my friends have the same problem. I initially thought some weird thing happened, but so many repetitions can't be a coincidence"
2222,1.0,This is worst product and don't buy it. Within 4 months I faced the speaker issue and replaced in warranty. But again in 3 months battery is not getting charged. I sent mail to imagine marketing id but no response. It seems that they have only faulty product. Also replaced product in warranty is used one. Worst product don't buy it.
2223,5.0,"Nice product, bought Boult wireless earphones but returned them because of bettary issue ... Boat ride up again in my view... These are best in this price.. nice ,bettary backup up good, material is soft smooth nice bass"
2224,2.0,Writing after one month of usage the supporting grips given are broken into pieces with in a month not expected such quality of product by Boat. Hope to get it replaced at service centre.
2225,1.0,The product arrived like this as you can see in the pictures. The main Bluetooth wireless earphone was missing. Only the charger was there. Its seems ridiculous. Very disappointed with this.
2226,3.0,I liked the product..... But carrying pouch is mentioned on the box but not in the box...... Also I didn't receive extra set of ear buds.. there is also bluetooth connection problem .... Sometimes it disconnects
2227,2.0,"Good earphone for sound quality but there is Bluetooth range problem , in specifications boat says 10m range but actually this earphone has range upto only 3m, when battery is below 50% it's Bluetooth range is only 1m, Also battery backup is very poor"
2228,2.0,Right earplug is only emitting partial sound. Very unbalanced audio for a new product.
2229,4.0,This earphone is good but not loudly sound. Bass is good clear sound and battery peformence is very good 6 to 8 hours backup fully charge
2230,5.0,"Build quality is awesome
Very light to handle.
Battery backup is good last for 5 hours on single charge.
Can keep volume to 30% is well and good enough to hear clearly.
Ear bud are good and able to easily fit in ears.
There is magnetic lock but it doesn't have any function this is only con of this product"
2231,5.0,Actually this headphone is great if you have any problem with it after the return time is over then go to boat main website then support you will get a video see it
2232,1.0,First 2 weeks everything wa fine. Then suddenly started hearing unwanted sound while on call. The person on the other side started complaining voice drop. Applied fir warranty. Took 1 month for replacement. Got the product back today Same issue. Some annoying background noise while on call.
2233,1.0,"This is a 5 star product but unfortunately had very bad experience in service ,it's not been even 6 months my oneside earpiece stopped and I tried to complain they rejected it saying wrong bill , as I have purchased it from amazon.in I attached the bill screenshots and the company rejected. Overall best product as per performance."
2234,3.0,Not worth upto the price of the item. Provides very less battery backup. I could only use it for like 2-3 hours listening in high volume. However it can stay if 5-6 hours listening in medium volume. Bass is average only. Doesn't give you the 'thumping' effect. In terms of noise cancellation it is very good. But lacks audio clarity
2235,4.0,"Bought this for rs 1999/- , easy on the ears and quite comfortable. Gives 3 hrs bty back up in a stretch ( that is max I tried so far). The bass is good. Can use it for run and gym sessions. Go for it."
2236,1.0,"The product which I have recieved it was fault one the one side of headphone is not working mean no sound from one side
The log was marked with ball pen in blue the box was also damage
That mean it was a used product which I have recieved
Very disappointed by this"
2237,4.0,"For all the bikers over there, it fits perfectly in helmet and doesn't cause much issues with the fit. just one thing about Sound Quality , it's for bass Heads , bass is bit overwhelming rest it's good buy"
2238,1.0,Replacement warranty third class service provider for customer
2239,2.0,It was quite alright whennit worked but after 3 months there is no sound on one side of the head phone. My son purchased a new one.
2240,4.0,"quality is good, connection issue sometimes, switching between 2 devices is not good as advertised, the part that rests on your neck is very flimsy and loose, other than that it's a nice product!"
2241,4.0,Thir should be carry case and Hookes that are fits in ear side should be available in different sizes according to ear. Overall product is Good.
2242,3.0,"You cannot talk to someone using this earphone because the noise cancellation is poor(lot of background noise), if you want to talk to some one u need a quiet room.
Other thing i didn't like is the amount of time it takes to turn up almost 3-4 sec and same to turn off.
What i loved :: Sound quality is good"
2243,3.0,"Sound quality is good , battery life is bakwas , overall you are always thinking about the battery and enjoy the music less . Buy some product which has more battery backup"
2244,4.0,"Awesome Product at Rs 800, Sound Quality is good, Noise Cancelation is ok, I almost tried all brand Bluetooth nech bands but only satisfied with boat, finally I gave overall 4 Star ... Need to improve battery backup and Bluetooth connectivity ..."
2245,5.0,"This is a good wireless earphone in mid range hence there is no rival or alternate option, this on is must buy if you are looking for wireless earphone"
2246,3.0,"In price point of view its goood, sound quality is not up to tha mark,, average mic quality, battery backup 5 hours continuous user, for moderate use it comes 3 days for me,, charging time 2.30 hours to full."
2247,4.0,"The product is osm at the price of 999. The quality is descent. The only thing that disappointed me is its wire. The wire is very thin, I think boat could give better wires quality."
2248,5.0,"Its wow awesome than other in this price

2249,5.0,Perfect Bluetooth earphones with the best sound quality available in the market. Bought it in 1k and realising one of my best purchases.
2250,4.0,"Good sound quality and perfect delivery by amazon
Overall a satisfying performance as using it from last 3 days. Battery performance is also good.
Basic requirement while Gym so been good and useful
Pricing can be a bit more competitive"
2251,2.0,"I got this product for Rs 999 . The sound quality is not that good enough . I purchased it since it had 22k+ reviews. Not value for money.
I would request all to search for an alternative if you can find on Amazon."
2252,5.0,"Good product, there is no issues with noise cancellation, sound quality is very much with bass and surrounding system,
Thanks to Boat and Amazon"
2253,5.0,Absolutely awesome earphones if u are tired of those wired kind of thing going just down there and annoying go wireless also the massive noise cancellation is very good with one charge it works on 5-6 hours of playback.it gives voice commands on this whether u are connected to the earphones or not.
2254,1.0,This is like a new movie with the same old story. Product has stopped working after 3 months of purchase and since then I am chasing the seller and Amazon for warranty claims. Well I didn't had any luck till date but I am hoping in coming year I will atleast be able to get through their customer service executives.
2255,4.0,Excellent Product but giving 4 star as sometimes MIC don't work.... I had replaced the item but still problem persists.. else for music ... Excellent one...
2256,4.0,"One of the best but not the greatest. Speaking of sound quality, Skull Candy's got better wireless bluetooth earphones. Rest is okay."
2257,3.0,"Only 3months gone.
I have used the Bluetooth earphones connected to my one plus 5 from last months.
There is a Bluetooth connectivity issue it is not establishing between the my one plus phone and the Bluetooth.
Boat is not recommending to use with one plus, if so please let us know . We can opt for other brands."
2258,4.0,"I wrote This review After Using 3 months this boat rockerzz 255
Trust me Guys It's Best Bluetooth headphones Under Budget
I Bought it in freedom Sale @ 999 rs.
Battery Life is good
Sound quality is best specially Bass Are awesome
Worth to buy it
Awesome Bluetooth Earphone"
2259,5.0,"Friends one thing I saying to you that no find unnecessary Bluetooth earphones
That's a time waste management

Go for boat this will give a powerful bass and something new sound you can't heard anywhere ok. See this review is my heatly take it and enjoy your day"
2260,2.0,"Not suited for pubg.
Typically disappointing after using for voice calls n playing pubg....creating worst noise ..!
Good for music but literally waste product for playing pubg writing review after one day use......"
2261,3.0,It worked pretty well for 8 months. Sturdy and wornderful sound quality. But the left earphone stopped working in 8 months. Now I am using it only with the righ earphone
2262,5.0,"i bought itfor 999,I purchased it second time. This is really good.Sound quality is really good.
You can connect 2 devices at a time.I connect laptop and mobile both.when listening muaic on Lappy, if u get a call, it switches to mobile,this switch between device is not good but again in this price its awesome.Comfortable on ear."
2263,4.0,"battery level is quickly down, but otherwise every thinks good, i.e. base, connecting, sound quality is excellent, i like it. money value is worth-able for this.

But this week I have charging in this head phones but burned and bhum sound so totally waste I can't use and I have loss my money."
2264,1.0,Item was defected peice bluetooth was not working.i have tried android mobile and IOsS mobile aswell as laptop not detecting properly. And also battery also not charging.
2265,5.0,The product is good with its sound quality and battery. But i doubt its durability as its very light and thin. Not worth to buy for 2500/- as I got it in 1000/- in amazon deal and hence no regret.
2266,1.0,"Not good sound quality and disconnects many a times. Also it shows 60% battery remaining and after 5min i get to hear ""oops battery down"".Not good for xiomi phones."
2267,1.0,I found the music quality of these headphones to be pretty substandard. They weren't able to block outside noise and the build was very filmsy.
2268,4.0,"While listening song , if you are on video call it does not work in proper way. Shows connectivity problems
Sound on one side of earphone differ from other it does not make a balnce base on both side ..
Only upto 10 metre range that is not enough..
Battery backup is poor on video call."
2269,1.0,"The product started malfunctions a month after buying
One earphone stopped working completely
Tried applying for a replacement through warranty but got no response from the company.
Now 6months later it's entirely stopped working.
Can't trust this product."
2270,4.0,"Pros:
1. The sound quality is great
2. Bluetooth is awesome. The range is great on it
3. The battery life is ok. But can be improved

Cons:
1. The calling sucks. The people on the other end either doesn't hear us, or there's too much disturbance."
2271,5.0,Best packaging ever and is tightly packed I feel very good and the sound quality and the build quality and the bass quality and the prices are best. Specially I love this boat rockerz 255 model it sounds better tan other.And it has ability to compare amount 5000 rupees bluetooth earphone
2272,4.0,"Really like the product. Used for 2 hours on music (50% Volume Sound) battery percent was still 100%
Had some calls sound is good and clear. Noice cancellation is ok type.
nil bluetooth connectivity issue.
Earbuds are soft/comfortable.
Quality of product is also good."
2273,3.0,"Very low bass as Compared with with Boat rockers 400 available at 1400 Rs. Seems like an average earphone, good bluetooth, build quality, good battery backup but poor sound quality, not so loud and very very poor bass. Good for calls may be coz of clarity, but definitely not for music !"
2274,5.0,sound quality is top notch. there's no active noise cancellation but the ear tips provide excellent isolation from surrounding sounds. bluetooth connectivity has been a mixed experience since it would struggle to stay connected to ur mobile especially when ur mobile is in u jeans pocket.
2275,4.0,"Got for Rs. 999/- during end of season sale. Pretty satisfied. Nice sound clarity & noise cancellation.
Battery backup could have been a little better not cannot complain, its managable."
2276,4.0,"I brought in 999 , amazing quality , sound is good, those who love more bass , will happy with this , unable to find how to connect two device simultaneously , rest is all ok , good headphone go for it."
2277,5.0,Much better than my other pair (boAt Rockers 400). And these are a lot less bulky too. Connectivity is easy and battery life is good for the price. Google assistant works too. 👍🏼👍🏼
2278,4.0,"Over bassy it hides instruments ,vocals mid and lows but it's personal preferences ok for base lover. interms of sound separation C100si is better. Battery backup is average full day with moderate uses . Facing a connectivity issue It disconnnect 5-6 times in a day.

Overall it's worth deal under Rs1000."
2279,1.0,"I am writing my personal & genuine review regarding to this product, after using one month later the quality and the function of this so called sports BlueTooth is very cheap,the BlueTooth is not even connecting to my phone suddenly its get switched off automatically."
2280,2.0,"Sound quality is very good but many times due to lack of noice cancelation in call opposite person not able to hear your voice properly.

Battery life is also less, 3 hours if you continue play music or play Games. After battery reach to 60% it drains within 15 mins."
2281,3.0,Sound quality is basic ... too basic. It cannot give the output that you would expect from boat. For music wit low volume is good. Cannot give output anywhere close to apple headsets
2282,1.0,"I am giving one start because as long product work fine , everything works fine, if any issue happens there is no one will respond properly, customer care (via email / phone )..my earphone suddenly stopped working one side , I managed one month then second side also stopped working ..now no one responding even it's in warranty"
2283,3.0,Product is ok. Sound mids and lows are ok. Sound gets diatracts if u increase volume above 70% . I found geekcases Status bluetooth headsets better than this bcoz it has Aptx sound technology in it which boat rockerz does not have.
2284,1.0,"Plz don't buy this product, these earphones sounds really good but if don't use it for say 2 weeks straight there is a chance that these earphones will not get switch on even if u plug in the charger still it doesn't responds. Plz don't buy this product buy something else but don't waste yur money on this one"
2285,2.0,"Was working fine however suddenly stopped working, unable to hear sound

Connection is happening however no sound"
2286,2.0,"Beautiful sound quality, noice cancellation. Only thing is first 1week I got good battery backup. Now it's not lasing enen for 1hr also. It's bad."
2287,5.0,"Sound Quality and the Noise Cancellation is Just Awesome,they worth the cost, Bluetooth Connectivity is also quite Good,Easy to Pair,and Finally it's main Pro is it's Battery BackUp,last atleast 5 hours every time I used it.It is worthy of the Cost.No case of Disappointmants,you will get satisfied."
2288,3.0,"Pros
-Sound is good for bass lovers
-High volumes contain distortion
-Three keys are running well
Cons
-Avarage build quality and look
-Avarage Bluetooth connectivity
-Avarage battery life
Conclusion
-Just buy if you care about only bass. Otherwise don't."
2289,3.0,"It's been 6 months I am using it sounds quality is good. Suddenly the battery is draining down a little faster compared originally and now I have a issue with charging, it doesn't charge instead it heats up when I put for charge (heats up too much)
I have raised for replacement for this product"
2290,3.0,"Sound Quality is good,Bass is not like what u get in Extra Bass Head in ear headphone but solves the purpose.Battery life is good but battery percentage shows incorrectly.Durability i feel the headphone Wire length is more little less would do no harm.
After using it for 1 year & 3 month the RH side earbud stop working.There is frequently Bluetooth loss issue, now not a single song is streamed uninterrupted."
2291,1.0,I am literally feeling vry bad.. i purchased in April only.. now August but my head phone are not working both ear buds are not functioning... Only Bluetooth paring in phone no sound in both buds. .. more charging for more than 5 hrs and play time up to only 3 to 4 hrs its ridiculous...
2292,5.0,"It makes you dance, so light weight, you can not even feel, it just you hear the pure bass. Loving it, This is the very first minute of usage when I am writing this review, Fingers crossed."
2293,1.0,The sound is so suppressed and there is no bass. The audio quality is so heavily compromised to meet the price point that it is better to not own a Bluetooth earphone than to own this one. Avoid getting duped!
2294,4.0,"The headphone is defined by one aspect only. BASS. The bass is is too loud for me to hear the soft details in music. The mids and highs are ok.
This headphone is for bass lovers only. I love balanced music and this is not for me.
Built quality is ok. Target price is about 1400/-. If more then go for Mi, JBL or Sony."
2295,4.0,"Nice headset , but battery is draining soon if it reaches 50℅, getting notified frequently by ivr which makes disturbed instead of that if there a beep sound it will be fine"
2296,4.0,Good sound. A little extra bass boosted. Biggest issue is noise cancellation on mic. There is a lot of background voice heard by the person with whom you will be talking.
2297,2.0,"1)Connectivity is very poor we always have to keep phone near to earphone.
2)Sound Is good.
3)Not useful for calling it disconnect call automatically.
4) while watching movie audio start breaking we have to turn off and on the earphones every time."
2298,5.0,"Every thing of this product it just great - The sound clarity, Bass level, battery life, design, light weight and comfort to use.
Only thing which I found on downside is its Bluetooth range and mic when on call. But with price of Rs 999, its much acceptable."
2299,5.0,Got it for my husband. It is of good quality n works fine too. Good packaging n prompt delivery. Got it on sale for 799/-
2300,2.0,"Worst product i have ever seen, I paid 1500 bucks on this earphone which was not worth it...Please guyz do not waste your money in this boat bluetooth earphone. Infact you can find more good sound quality and comfortability in another brand in the same price."
2301,2.0,After using this product for more than 20-25 days..I found Bluetooth connectivity gets lost or experience weak signals in public place/crowded location. Also sound disturbance occurs in between while watching videos.
2302,5.0,"During the call, the other side people will not hear you properly you have to lift the mic and hold it till the time you're speaking. also there is no direct contact between PH and headphone so you can't play the FM. Rest is all gud. Sound quality is better."
2303,3.0,Overall good but connectivity range is not good!! Have to close phone with you not even 5-6 step away voice break issue starts
2304,4.0,"I liked 1. Build quality 2. Easy to connect 3. Quality of sound is good 4. Charging backup is fine.
Overall boat rockers is good product, I would give 5 online drawback is Bluetooth connection range is not good, it’s better to improve range.
Then using of Bluetooth make sense"
2305,4.0,"Here you go,

Sound wise it's super ... In starting use it has a great sound quality and awesome bass however as time spends ( almost around 20 days ) magnet of buds gets weaker and even sound quality & bass also gets decreased. However it's still good deal, I bought in 1000."
2306,1.0,"Maxim login. This is what i hear after connecting. She keeps saying that. Faulty product. Its a faulty product. Go for boat 400 . its far far better.
250, 255r series is faulty. I need to go to service center. Just dont hv time right now."
2307,3.0,To much unnecessary bass which result into less clear beats. The product build quality is superb. Noise cancellation is also good. The only factor which comes in negative is too much bass which will decrease the sound quality as well as give you a headache. Didn't like at all refunded and ordered NOISE product..HONEST REVIEW
2308,1.0,"Sound quality is adequate.
Product quality is poor.
With very light to moderate use one side of earphone stop working within 4 months and I know a lot of people with the same issue.
I bought it for Rs999
What else you can get with this price
but it won't justify if it is more than that."
2309,3.0,"Im using this product since 2 months and in specs it says it connect two device at a time but no it takes to much time to connect and also dosent work properly after connection, mic quality is also not good!!"
2310,4.0,If ya listen music for long hour then plz dont buy this... its produced heavy bass and its good for 5 or 10 minutes but after that i cant enjoy your music... thats only issue.. well ita for well in ear
2311,1.0,Most of the times the bluetooth connection is getting lost. And the range also poor. Even if i keeping my mobile nearby the headset the connection is not steady and distortion in sounds. Bad product
2312,5.0,"It's very good product, gives me a backup of whole 8-10 hours with medium usage. Songs for about 5-6 hours on low volume, along with calls for about 1-2 hours.
I recommend this, as it is worth the price."
2313,3.0,I had a skullcandy head set earlier so this is a step down but i wanted a cheaper option. The sound is ok. Only issue is the wires are too long for me and it is not very comfortable to wear on cycle or bike.
2314,4.0,"Sound is like good but its not good as we are expecting from the Company name - BOAT !
Yup It work fine with my OnePlus 6 .
Bluetooth range is fine with my handset but it is not good with redmi note 4 ,5 and 6 . It will show some lag when your handset is in your jeans pocket."
2315,5.0,Excellent service I purchased them in January 2019 and in June 2019 both headphones stopped working...I contacted the boat service center and as it was in1 year replacement warranty...to my surprise after a procedure within 10 days I got new pair of headphones replaced delivered to my door step... awesome service
2316,4.0,"Response is better on lower frequencies. Equalizing required as per mobile hardware/ sound configuration or personal choices.
Surrounding effect response could be better.
Less responsive on high mid to higher frequencies. Battery backup is pretty good."
2317,5.0,"Go for these in sales.
Everything is impressive about this product ..... just be aware of the seller.
Bcz I have faced issues while checking out with this product."
2318,3.0,"They are fine pair on bluetooth headphones. The sound quality is good. I didn't like the noise cancellation that much. The bluetooth conductivity is good.
Sound quality - 👍👍👍
Noise cancellation - 👍👍
Bluetooth connectivity - 👍👍👍

And considering the price its a pretty good deal."
2319,4.0,"Good bass thumps your music overall music quality is good,once you pair it second time it will connect super fast with your device,range is less as you travel frm one room to another the sound getting disconnected,it troubles in range which phones having Bluetooth v5.0 and with Bluetooth v4.2 the range is slightly increase."
2320,3.0,"Returned it , reason being cable is like a neck collar whereas image on site gives an impression and second thing build material quality is not good ."
2321,5.0,"The best thing is sound quality and battery. That's simply superb. But the problem with it is the length of the wire. It looks somewhat awkward at the first look.
The rest is up to the mark. Should be Handled with care."
2322,4.0,Sound quality is amazing and water resistant also worked well at the gym.... And while riding its easy to take call.... The down side is the noice cancelation don't work well....
2323,2.0,"used it for the whole day
the quality of sound is good
wire quality is not even good
and the Bluetooth quality is totally disruptive
there are lags in between.
Bluetooth's range is too short
overall at this pricepoint not a worthy investment"
2324,3.0,"Sometimes I am getting disturbance when my phone is in my pants pocket.
Some issue is there wrt connectivity which is critical thing.
Rest everything is good"
2325,1.0,Worst product. Consistent disturbance within 2 weeks of purchase. Worst sound quality. Seems to be cancelling out music and just transmitting noise. Gets disconnected and connected on its own accord. So minus points in terms of Bluetooth connectivity. Not recommended at all!!
2326,2.0,"After 6 months of use, the headphones have developed a problem of repeating the same song on loop every 5 to 10 seconds. The battery too didn't last that long."
2327,3.0,"Overall product is fine,sound is Crystal clear,not deep bass ,but every day usage purpose it is very good and as per price point of view ,it is economical."
2328,3.0,"This one has great sound. Battery life is also good. Connects to your device quickly. The only complain is that microphone picks even slightest surrounding noise while on call.
Edit: One side stopped working after 4 months and other side followed in couple of days. The replacement came without box (probably refurbished) but works well."
2329,5.0,"This is my 5th boat's product in last 3 years ...
i trust this company's products blindly.. this earphones is value for money.. very light weight .. sound quality is awesome... Purchase it without wasting time ur time in reading reviews .. go for it ..
Sound quality is no doubt best in this segment..."
2330,2.0,"Got this product delivered on 8 August 2019, and its 9 November 2019, one of its cord is not functioning properly. The sound is cut off.
Boat, being such a big player in this industry gives 15 days guarantee or return policy, now I know why!
Within 3 months, the product failed to deliver its purpose. Disappointed"
2331,3.0,While listening to songs it's good ...but for call conversation it is very cheap product.. it should be priced around Rs.300 to 400..but I bought it @ rs.900 ...but actual price shows Rs.1400 ... don't know how it priced
2332,1.0,"I bought this product in Jan'19, but after 3 or 4 months the right speaker is not working properly, it has very less sound volume..
Don't know if there is settings to be done..
Can anyone help if right speaker is not working or settings need to be changed.."
2333,5.0,"Best quality earphones I have ever used. Crystal clear sound, robust build and lighting fast connect makes it highly recommend."
2334,3.0,"So far, it's good but it has got little noise problem and battery is doing great job(played music continuously for more than 6hrs). I donno if it's good for that price(I got it for 1399) but the quality is also good. I haven't got any bill."
2335,5.0,"Okay I am using this product for 1 day or so and here are some of my thoughts :
Pros :
1. Cheap
2. Good Bass
3. Nice call quality
4. Good battery life
Cons :
1. Sound is a bit shrill
2. Bluetooth range is very less

2350,4.0,"Doesn't suport aptx, so the sound lags a few milli seconds. Not suitable if you are going to use it for games like PUBG.
Rest all good. Value for money.
Bluetooth range is approx 10ft. and that's sufficient.
Bass good, Treble good, Qualtiy good.
Decent for calling purpose. Haven't faced any mic issue."

-- Totally NOT Recommended --"
2367,1.0,"Boat headset company was making a very poor quality products ,The boat products will work only two or three months after that it will not work and they giving one year warranty but its No use for service or replacement.

."
2368,3.0,"ordered it on 16/06/2019, lasted for 6 months and now the left earphone does not work anymore. So durability sucks, sound is great and good battery."

the volume is a little on lower side in its full capacity but still i heard at 70 % volume and that was enough

2375,4.0,Only recommended for people who like the base a little too loud and enjoy the pop and rock as the sound in this category plays a dominant role and not the audio. You can’t really enjoy soft music on this.

2381,1.0,"The sound quality of this earphone is really poor, even the wired earphones of boats are way much better than that of wireless product. The noise cancellation is good not bad and there is also no problem with Bluetooth connectivity.But what's the meaning of all features if the sound quality of the earphone is not good."

2384,5.0,"What an item it is!! Must say, the sound quality, the design, specially the bass effect is just perfect. While the songs are played, you just loose yourself in the mood and the sound quality makes you feel that it is real. Completely happy purchasing the product. Please purchase if would like to."
2385,1.0,"Very bad and dissatisfying service. its one side is not working after 3months of my purchase, I complained but no Response from Boat and there courier partner is completely irresponsible. Will never purchase from BOAT again."

Compare to Jbl but u need to look out for cost too
But the sound is enough to make uhh dance ,mood peace,enjoy & ignore mode on"
2390,5.0,I only doubt the noise cancellation. But it a wonderful product. Bass and voice is perect. Material is best one. I want not for listening songs but to use it for bike and it is doing good.

2393,3.0,Hi guys.. i baught this product at a time of amazon sale. So i got a good deal of INR 1499/- in this price its very good product if you are looking for bluetooth handsfree. Connectivity & battery life is very good. But sound quality is not that much good. Overall its a good and decent product.. nthng spl as much.
2394,4.0,"When you are on headphone while on call , other party gets to listen all the noise around you which significantly reduces voice quality. Music quality otherwise is fantastic"
2395,3.0,All about sound is very good..if you like bass.. Then go for it.. Cons- there is no noise cancellation.. Lots of Distribution are coming while talking.. Some time Bluetooth disconnected when your phone is in ur pocket..

2399,4.0,"Current battery status of the device is misleading. From 80% to 0 will be drained out in few mins. Battery status shown in the app (BOAT Bluetooth app from playstore) is also misleading.
Sometimes it is not so convenient to open charging ""cap""

Overall good product"
2400,4.0,"The build quality of this wireless is just awesome & the battery life is also fair enough, I charge it first time after 5 days of unboxing it. But sometimes I feel that the sound is not loud enough as compare to other earphones and there is no treble in sound it is just baas dominated earphone."
2401,4.0,"The people who complain about BASS don't know why? But i use PowerAmp app for music..
Just got in one delivery and the product is just aweeeesome...
Sound quality 4*
Bass 5*
Design 3.5 *
Comfort 4.5 *..
Thanks Boat and Amazon.."
2402,3.0,"I ordered another product ""Boult Audio ProBass Curve"" along with this.

boAt Rockerz 255 Product is good but Design should change similar to Boult Audio ProBass Curve.
Auto-off is not available with this if we are not working for a longtime ."
2403,1.0,"First of all, the product was packed in a used box which means that the piece was already returned by someone. And the music stops in between a lot. I'm not happy with the service. I already returned this product once. The previous one had buzzing sounds in between. And this one has also come up with its own problems."
2404,1.0,"Stopped working within 4 months of purchase. 2 months into the buy, lieft side stopped and 2 months post that the right one. Please do not buy. Waste of money."
2405,5.0,"First I would like to write the cons:
1. The ear plug piece doesn't fit as T which leads to pain in earlobes after using for sometime.
2. Battery drains immediately from 50% to 0
Apart from the above we have only pros. Fantastic sound quality with noise cancellation! Worth for money spent!"
2406,1.0,"Please don't buy this product...
One of the worst Bluetooth Earphones I bought in Amazon 😣.
After 1 month the wires became loose and shows some connectivity error....
While playing pubg there is 1 second latency"

2411,4.0,Ok stuff.... Did not meet expectations tuning is a bit off... Too much bass... Where no bass needed there also bass comes... Funny
2412,1.0,Battery backup is third class.. pls don't buy this hyped product. I received the product in a squeezy box for which I'm OK but the power back up in this earphones is worst. I heard only 2 songs and one phone call of 5mins. That's all. Battery was down from 80%to 20%
2413,2.0,"It works fine for music however when used for calls either via mobile or Skype calls via PC, the voice breaks a lot. This is not a network issue as while the call is still on if you switch from Bluetooth to phone the call works fine.. so it's definitely the Bluetooth"
2414,1.0,Product was having battery issue from the beginning and used to have unusual sound disturbance even when battery was more than 40% charged. Earphone used to get heated a lot while charging but I ignored this problem and continued to use the earphone. Now the product is melted due to overheating. Lost ₹1500 . Pathetic
2415,2.0,"Sound quality is ok. I won't complain that much about the sound quality for this price group. Stereo effect and surround sound could hv been better. And battery also.
What it really annoyed me is it's connectivity problem. You will experience Lag and interruptions in sound when you walk or just sway your mobile."

2420,4.0,"Good quality, battery life is good, but don't wear both ear while driving we unable to hear outside voice, in one ear enough for hear and speaking, sound quality is good but not better best. Charge fast.

Fits exact on ears
Best quality and value for money

I know i can ask help from service centre to het it fix moreover my concern is why the product quality is so low that it is not working now.
2433,4.0,"The bass output could have been better. Sound quality is adequate, nothing great. In ear fit is very comfortable and secure. Good value for money"
2434,4.0,"Very good on a budget, specially when a lot of product at this price are just average..

My wife Liked it.."
2435,5.0,Didn't have high expectations with these but I must say that I am pleasantly surprised. They sound great and connect very easily with any Bluetooth device. Their battery lasts 8 hours of continuous use and a standby time of weeks.
2436,1.0,"The battery backup is too bad.. On a full charge you can't even get 2 hrs of movies + 20 mins of call over a 7 hrs standby. Don't buy this product, I will return it."

2438,1.0,"Just after 3 months of purchase, one side of headphone stopped working. Now both sides are not working. Initially I was very happy with the product but now I am very disappointed with the product. Als, after saying 1 year warrenty/gurantee, there is no option to replace the item. Seriously this is very disapppointing."
2439,4.0,Sound quality is good but the distance is not covering 5 meter also. I kept mobile is hall and went to next room. Not able to here clearly.
2440,1.0,"1.Earbuds are too soft & Slippery, it's falling down like anything.
2. Volume buttons are not working properly.
3. Can you guys (Boat) produce simple wireless bluetooth earphone without any extra head of earbud"
2441,1.0,"Horrible experience. Stopped working after 3 months of purchase. Left ear piece does not play/respond. Quiet unhappy and dissatisfied. A Friend advised of how to get a replacement warranty claimed, I've raised a ticket but no response at all. Its been 3 weeks now since I raised the ticket."
2442,4.0,"It's an on-an-average earphones, it turns on more and more bass to any sound...e.g you'll not like tecno beats in this earphones.
It has very low grade clear voice
If you like bass or thick voice it's for you. I am rating 4 for its battery life, durability, price, comfortability.
Sound is not good.."
2443,1.0,"The product was not up to my expectation.

The covering box itslef damaged and with full of dust and all.

At first I was not able to open the charging port. Then somehow I managed to open the same and the small and tiny port cover was broken.

Very bad experience from amazon and boat"
2444,5.0,"I ordered 5 Bluetooth earphone headsets
Among them all I kept only this one
Sound quality and bass owsome
Quality material used is very good
Fits on ear very nicely"
2445,4.0,Sound quality is good at this price. Bass effect also good. No noise. Only problem I faced is uncomfortable wear - Little weight in the ear buds and lengthy wires. Could be little less weight and short wires. Sharp 6 hrs battery life.
2446,2.0,"The sound quality sucks on this one. It's not really comfortable for long usage. You don't hear balanced audio and lose the characters of mid and high notes. Not recommended for immersive audio. Considering this is the cheapest branded Bluetooth earphone available, use it for phone calls."
2447,3.0,"Unhappy with the noise cancellation, it cancells your voice but not the noise during calls.

Apart from that the ear plugs are slightly diacomforting and comes out while working out sometimes.

Just the sound quality for music is good"
2448,3.0,"Overall the earphones are good at the price 999 but I have faced one issue while using it.
While watching the video on MX Player the video gets stuck and the audio keeps playing. If I play same video using wired earphone that time the video and audio plays smoothly without any issue."
2449,3.0,I got this in 999. I am using this product last 2 month. When i connect with mobile for listening music than the wireless headset working good but calling is not properly always call voice is cracking. So this product only for listening music and vedio not for call

2452,2.0,"A very sad product..below are my list of observations
1) gets disconnected from the paired devices automatically if not in use beyond an hour
2) zero noise cancellation
3) poor battery life
4) infact mine has a special feature which adds an unnecessary background noise while on conference calls"
2453,5.0,"I got this product before 2 months

1>> sound quality 5/5
2>> bass 4/5
3>> battery backup 4.5/5
thanks boat Rockerz & Amazon."
2455,5.0,"What I felt is I had boat 225 wired earphone so if I compare the wired to this wireless 255 then its 19-20 difference, boat 225 wired gives 1 point better experience than the 255 wireless one, battery life is good of the product, magnets do there job as expected. I bought this for 1500 so overall good product, will recommend this."
2456,1.0,"Bluetooth connectivity is very poor, its breaking down, even when my laptop is in front of me, it isn't getting automatically connected to my devices even swift pairing is on, noise cancellations is not working for me is, should I replace it or the device is itself like this."
2457,5.0,"Noise cancellation is not upto the mark.. When speaking, the listener could listen other disturbing noises than my voice though my mouth is near to the mike. Sound for music is amazing. Only thing is to update with the proper noise cancelling."
2458,2.0,"Failure model as the built quality is very poor. Unlike Samsung level and Boalt, for example, it's made up of rubberized material and neck band and volume button parts are not assembled/pasted properly."
2459,4.0,"It's really good...
Clear sound and some extra bass..
It's good think that when you listen old songs that time you feel little bit of bass of old songs...
This product I've use on Mi device it's good...
But others handset's have not to good sound..
If u change sound effect then you satisfy.

Thank you.."

2461,1.0,"I have bought it 2 times but 1st time when I paid the actual price without any discount I got the Good quality product, But then second time I bought the same product with discount and then the quality of both the headphones and its box is so cheap, It doesn't even look like the actual BOAT product."
2462,4.0,"It's a good head phone. After using three months I am reviewing it.
1.Bluetooth connectivity is good, it covers my hole house.
2.Noise cancellation is good.
3. But base sound is not up to the mark.
4. its charge can run upto 3-4 hours with connection.
Over all I'm satisfied"
2463,5.0,"One of the best brands that fits in everyones pocket. Bought for 999, superb sound quality even when compared to samasun icon earbuds. The earphones may lack storage but the sound quality is mind blowing. Just in love with them."
2464,4.0,"Bought it on the Amazon prime day sale for 999 and at that price it is a really a good earphone.
As it's an in ear earphones good with the noise cancellation and doesn't move while running/jogging.
The bass is a little higher but overall a decent product"

2466,4.0,"If you are looking for budget friendly Bluetooth earphones that this is the one. Two issues that I have noticed, product has no voice cancellation, hence if you are traveling in any noisy place, earphones will not be of help. The battery backup is okok."
2467,4.0,"It's an amazing earphones with great noise cancellation n sound clairty, but if bass your kinda thing, then you should go for boatz headphones."
2468,4.0,but unfortunately vibration alert not working even after replacement. that means this feature is not there in this product.
2469,5.0,"Had no issues with the item for almost 9 months.. When I did run into problem, Boat arranged for a return pickup and replaced the item within 10 days - ALL FREE OF COST.. Love it.."
2470,2.0,"This product is worst
Build quality is poor
If you wear half hour your ear will feel pain
And you will feel discomfort
You can go for some other one
I bought this earphone at prize of 999
Now it cost 2300
It showing the ear phone don't have much
Quality ,"
2471,5.0,Good so far however fails to connect to 2 devices at time. Fail to tell u battery status suddenly says battery low and turns off. Noise cancellation is not good when u r on a call.
2472,4.0,"Battery life is good.
Sound quality is good.
There is no additional sound cancellation feature for this product like senhizer, Bose..etc.
But its value for the money.
Bass is good at this price range."
2473,2.0,Well excellent sound quality and provides good noise cancellation .. but when the controller catches the sweat the buttons do not function properly.It's just a month and this has happened twice now so if these people are mentioning that sport earphones they pls don't fall for that.. its just useful for normal and just be thoughtful.
2474,3.0,"Product is working, getting connected to mobile but speakers stopped working.
Last month one speaker stopped and now another one.

Need a help for repair"
2475,5.0,"My favorite companion while I'm traveling or driving..great sound. The highs, mids and lows, are perfectly balanced.."
2476,2.0,"Range is not more than 5 meters ,little disappointed but good quality product.
Too much of noise from the product , many calls to disconnect because of bad sound quality"
2477,1.0,"Worked fine for a few days and then the left ear speaker started a little crackling sound and now it has grown worse, so much that i cannot use it anymore. And this is within a month of buying. Pls tell me how to return it."
2478,4.0,"Overall product is awesome. Call quality and mild bass. Good product.

1st received used product, returned and good new one."
2479,5.0,"I am fan of Sony just becoz of the Bass. But at this price point Rs. 999 This is real beast of Bass compare with Sony. I have purchased 3 earphones for mine friends and for my brother.

I am really happy with this purchase."
2480,1.0,Pls don't buy this wireless headphone. I had automatic switch off headphone even not continue work 10-15 minut. I don't know why Amazon select such as product in Amazon's Choice list. Waste of money.
2481,5.0,"super bass or base, which is what i am looking for, good volume, not tested calls, this review just after first testing."
2482,2.0,"This earphones are unreliable, i bought it before 3 months meanwhile right side ear buds got cracked automatically and it got divided in two parts, and sound quality is also not that much good but ok, one more thing bass is not good as it is a boat earphones.
Biggest thing Yaar thye are not pic and thye are not exchange it"
2483,4.0,"Bass is good and also the sound quality.
It connects with device very quickly.
Earbuds are kinda painful if you use for a long duration .
Worthy enough to buy."
2484,5.0,"Good value for money.
It's rugged and has a good range.
The wire is a little long for me but it's not a big issue as such"
2485,1.0,"I was super excited to get these headphones but it stopped working today after almost 6 months. There right ear piece has stopped giving output.

Don't waste your money and time on this."
2486,5.0,Earphones are working well......built quality is ok ....looks are good enough.....battery life is awesome......wire size is also good enough....speaker sound is good and....bass effect is like 75% ....overall the product is good under this price range.....cons: built quality should be more better....still fine
2487,4.0,I am using it from last 3days the battery backup is superb i like the sound quality but not as good as JBL but not disappointing at all....at the price if 999 it is actually a great deal ....i have ordered one more the red one and i already had black one...... delivery is fast got the product within one day.....
2488,4.0,"This is good product. But cost wise little high for this. Same cost better Bluetooth earphones in same amzon so this is also good but this is not best.

So try any other new brands."
2489,3.0,"Bass is really good, but overall sound quality is comprised and everything is just the bass. The sound quality is equivalent to those earphones available in market from 100-200 price range. Also these so called wireless earphones doesn't charge when plugged into a power bank."
2490,4.0,"I have bought 3 Boat Rockers 255 in last 1 year and in exactly 6-7 months one side of earphone stopped working in all 3 earphones. After complaints Boat team replace the product but such issue is not expected from Boat....

Also Bluetooth connection takes 25 minutes with every new device."
2491,4.0,"While playing music if we chat on Instagram or WhatsApp the music stop's playing and suddenly again starts
Don't know why it stops?
That's the main thing I didn't like it about this product
But sound quality is best as it's boAt Company
Battery backup is also best.."
2492,5.0,"Using from 1 month:
Sound quality : 4/5
Bass :5/5
Look: 5/5
Material :5/5
Battery: 3/5.

I liked it very much.(I am a bass lover)"
2493,5.0,"Good one day battery back up
Using with Samsung M30"
2494,1.0,I received used product. Really disappointed with this. I paid for the new unsed Item. original seal of the box is already broken and that was covered by a transferent tape.
2495,1.0,Fraud company. Within 6 month its became faulty. I use their warranty replacement policy the pic my product after generating complai. Now after 2 month still I am not receiving my product and not any call or massege. Their costumer care No. never work. Don't buy ever from Boat . Don't waste your money and time.
2496,3.0,"No doubt Sound quality is fantastic. Noise cancellation I would say not very good but some extent ok. Finally Bluetooth connectivity is not very poor and it doesn’t work even within another corner in room.
If you are ok with compromising Bluetooth connectivity than this might be good product in this price."
2497,1.0,Please dont buy this product. My humble request to all. Choose the best product event at the cost of premium also. Not this product.
2498,2.0,"Not good fitting.. mic is not good enough too much disturbance
In this budget it's a decent product to switch to bluetooth"
2499,5.0,"Bass, sound quality all are good. Bettery back is also good if we fully charged and use not frequent (for call,and in free tym listening music) than its run 2 days"
2500,3.0,Good noice cancellation and sound quality.. Ear piece not comfortable...Paining ... Can't keep for more than an hour
2501,4.0,Over all good product. Battery backup is 7 to 8 hrs of usage. Fits well in ears. The only problem i face is that noise cancellation is very strong so if i m puttung on these bluetooth i m not able to listen to anyone.
2502,3.0,"The sound quality is good, the highs and lows are well balanced, but when it comes to the bass its a bit less.
The range of the bluetooth is very low, it works well if you are in the same room, but as soon as you move towards the next room it gets disconnected."
2503,4.0,"If you're looking for blaring sound quality and bass then there are better products out in the market. This is a good piece for the average music listener. Not good for genres like punk or rock, along those lines.
The fit is perfect, build quality is excellent. Just the sound is dissatisfying."
2504,4.0,Sometimes there is connectivity issue. I have one plus 5. When phone is in pocket there is connectivity isssue every 2 mins. There is disturbance of connectivity loss for few milliseconds. Dont know whether it is earphone's or phone's issue.
2505,1.0,"Bought these on 4th of February, and I am writing this review on 3rd of March. The Bluetooth connectivity is dead and is not getting connected at all. Even if it gets connected the connection is lost after keeping my phone in pocket.Really not satisfied with the product. This was my fourth boat product and services are worse than their products"
2506,5.0,Best one. Got it in 999 rs. I also have weared it in rain. Good water resistance. Mostly use it while cycling. It is sweat proof too. Easy to use. Sticks in ear even while you are running fast and still very comfortable... Thank you boAt...
2507,4.0,"The reduction in noise from outside is really good however the sound quality could have been much better. Good stuff at this rate. The draw back is it doesn't show how much charging is left, it would keep showing as full even after 3-4hrs of use."
2508,5.0,Headset battery gone now after using 5 months. Not able to get battery in market. But very nice service from boat. Raised a complaint online boat replaced product in 5 days.
2509,5.0,This product is just a mind-blowing with extra bass and battery life is excellent compared to other product. I have purchased it for @899 best price ever.
2510,5.0,My experience with Boat Rockerz 255 is amazing..the qualityof this product is very good..a crystal clear sound with a very good bass quality..awful noise cancellation..it is also very light in weight thus it is easy to carry..I am totally in love with this product .don't think twice just go for this product ..
2511,2.0,I am giving this product a 2 star rating inky because it remained functional for only two months from the date of purchase. I have used cheaper earphones and costly ones too .. but none of them malfunctioned so soon. Totally disappointed. Quality was just okayish to start with. But it has stopped working now.
2512,1.0,Bluetooth pairing started having problem after 15 day of use. Not discoverable either by laptop or mobile or by any other devices. Dont buy
2513,3.0,Ok product. Good for calls and won't impress the music affacinados. Within a month the left earphone is not working properly. The volume distribution between the two is disturbed. Bluetooth range is not impressive either.
2514,4.0,The best part of this product is flexibility and sweat proof ..its have aws base quality ..its very useful while driving and we need to talk on call .....but its battery backup is not upto the mark ..but overall it's a nice product with aws quality
2515,4.0,"Writing a review after using it over a month
Great Sound with bass. Fits very well in the ear.
I would rate battery a 3 star. It drains bit faster. With normal use you can manage 1 or 2days. If being rigorously used it may last upto 12 hrs."
2516,1.0,"Sound quality awesome and has Super Bass..
But suddenly one day after 3months one stopped working and I couldn't not get the service center in Delhi... So I not able to use it properly"
2517,3.0,Average product .sound is not clear it is not as good as Sennheiser CX 180
2518,2.0,"There is zero noise cancellation. Instead of the person who is using the earphones, nearby everyone else's voice is more loud to hear. In case you are accepting any other call during existing calls then Bluetooth connectivity doesn't stays.
Only for songs this is best as per the price range."
2519,2.0,"Sound Quality is good, however for calls these earphones are worst. Instead of me speaking on phone, caller hears all the background noise. Also it seems it amplifies background noise rather than my voice on call. So I will not suggest it, if you are purchasing for calls."
2520,4.0,The product is good. Good Volume like home Theatre when listening from Both ear pods. But sometimes while talking on phone the voice gets very blurry and difficult to understand. This also started after 2 weeks of usage. Overall Good Product
2521,5.0,"Wireless,lightweight and flat cable!!

My requirement is fulfilled as I was looking for a wireless for my type C supported phone.

It worked.

Thank you Boat & Amazon!"
2522,2.0,Good hear song but wen it has change to next song or some message has came some beep sound has interacting in between the song it’s too horrible to hear it make some fear in body if u can give me a immediate solution I can’t bare it
2523,4.0,"Bought for 999

Pros..
Great sound
Ample battery life
Light weight
Noise isolation

Cons...
Poor battery management..
(100% for 2hrs, 80% for next 1.5 hr
60% for 1 hr then backup comes tumbling down...keep a charger handy always)"
2524,4.0,"Great base , superb loudness.. 80% comfortable for longtime use
But other treble sound is little clumsy..."
2525,3.0,"Ear starts paining after use of an hour... Sound quality is not so good...
Price is high according to the quality of product"
2526,4.0,"Best headphones but sometimes a little problm with Bluetooth connectivity but it's okay it's not big use
But in other view sometimes sound is dispper in headphone and when u move a noise in headphone"
2527,2.0,"Battery backup is low when it show 80% it's shut down in 15 min

Audio quality can say only average

Ear bud is not comfortable it makes pain in ear for more than 20 min if u keep

No vibration on call

Audio call voice is not good"
2528,3.0,"All is good.
Only major issue I faced is that the Ear supporter Clamp falls every now and then with it the inner ear grip too.
Thats causing a great inconvenience and I am sure it will get lost someday."
2529,3.0,"The headphones are great to use and I have no complaints about the sound quality. It's just that quite recently the mic has stopped working, I can't use the Bluetooth set as a hands-free device to take calls. Could you please tell me the process for replacement, the product is new and well within the warranty period."
2530,4.0,Using this from 3 months and now I am writing this review . First if you are lucky you got this approx 800. Connectivity excellent. Battery backup good. Sound quality is good if you are average listener .
2531,1.0,"Left side one isn't working... Today is the 1st of November, it's return period got over on the 28th... It's not that it isn't working from today... It was creating disturbance since almost a week but I took it lightly as I really trust bost products and amazon as well... But seriously, extremely disappointed"
2532,1.0,Worst ever headphone I bought..after five months one side stopped working.then I got replacement but few days after replaced headset could not get connect..now have connection problem
2533,2.0,"Good but bass is not that good. I mean I hear it very clear but not loud bass...and it turns off at 20% battery . not showing correct % of battery charge left.

Now its charging only 80%(8-3-20)"
2534,4.0,"It's a really nice product with great battery backup and sound clarity.
If something goes wrong with your device within the warranty period, you can get it replaced easily.

The connectivity is a little week when you are riding too fast on bike."
2535,5.0,This product is extremly awesome.The battery life is 6 hours by charging only 30 min.This i like it.. Pairing of blooth is very fast.
2536,4.0,"Battrey backup 3/5
Sound Quality 3/5 Do Not expect great bass
Value for Money 4/5
Bluetooth Reception 3/5

Considering price of 1K its an good product for daily use"
2537,3.0,"While I like the sound it emanates, I don’t like the fitting. It sits on your ears and makes you feel uncomfortable after a while, at least did so to me. I liked the earphones by Apple the most, not the wireless ones, but the classic one, sound perfect, fits comfortably."
2538,2.0,"It was a super earphone,build quality and bass was good. It comes around 5-6hours with a solid 100% charge.. But after 6months of use(2-2.5hours of daily usage) the right earpiece is not working. It was such a good earphone but it wasn't durable enough. Not for long term use better buy something which is durable"
2539,4.0,"Sound quality is very good superb for hearing songs, but mic when attending phone call little bit volume problems."
2540,3.0,If you guys looking for playing pubg.. Buy it now. Only if your phone has Bluetooth 5.0. Than only it will not lag in gaming. And earphone are good in sound. Package delivery was worst. With any protection cover or carton..
2541,1.0,"There is no noise cancelation, sound quality is fine but Bluetooth connectivity is for name sake! It gets disconnected after each minute! Can't use it for calling too, cannot talk because of poor connectivity! Both the sides stop working in few days! Very disappointed and worthless!"
2542,5.0,"I have seen my collegue's boar rockerz and decided to go for this.
It is too Good. The surround Sound and micro sound are really clear, The Battery life is also Good and I am enjoying each bit of it.
The Call clarity and reception is too good and I am really Happy about it"
2543,1.0,"Its not good as Its been only 5-6 months.. and the right earphone is not working now.
Can someone guide from where i can go for replacement or so?
I'm fed up now."
2544,5.0,Perfect for this price.working well.battery works for 4to5hr.after full charge.sound and base quality is superb. Handling is also perfect.
2545,4.0,"Boat rockerz 275's sound quality is superb with superb bass and supports voice assistant also. I suggest everyone to buy this wireless in-ear headphone. I got it at just ₹999. After using 6 months regularly, one side of the earphone was not working, but after complaining on the site, I got a new boat rockerz255 in replacement within a month."
2546,5.0,"Better than sony c200 ... excellent sound quality, great microphone, flexible n quality material ... good battery back up ..."
2547,3.0,"Just received yesterday, After 6 hrs use starting of neck pain and feeling heavyness in left ear , is this due to technical fault of earphone or from what? Should i just replace it? And in packaging there is no bill of product , Though sounds quality and battery is good. Need help please suggest @boatnirvana"
2548,5.0,"Great sound, awesome bass.... Only issue i found is tht the wire is too long, it's hard to carry it around... I was using philips shb 5250, and this is supposed to be a replacement.. But due to the wire length shifted back to philips... As its a hassle while driving"
2549,1.0,Worst product. Waste of money . Not even work for 2 months properly. Boat is worst. Not known where we repair before warranty expires.. go for local brands they are better than this bloody boat products.
2550,5.0,"Good quality earphones.
Sound quality is very awesome
But i have noticed one issue.
Sometimes sound stops abruptly and starts again. Dont know why.
And while playing games like pubg sound lag occurs ,sound plays lately"
2551,1.0,Stopped working just in a month. No service center around. Registered complaint but No one come to pick up the product. Replacement SLA is too high 15 days. DONT BUY BOAT HEADSET ... GO FOR SOME REPUTED BRAND WITH GOOD AFTER SALES SERVICE
2552,5.0,No doubt it does quality job... Especially when we get the items in deal... Bought 4 for my friends & family... Minimum guarrenty...
2553,5.0,"Very satisfied with boAt Rockerz 255 - Superb sound, extreme bass and good noise cancellation; Got it at Rs. 999/- Highly recommend"
2554,5.0,"For the price worth 999 its worth every penny, its a good quality headphones, the sound is amazing, and connectivity is effortless, charge and backup is great. Recommended product. Even if you buy it for the price of 1499 its worth to buy the same."
2555,4.0,Easy to manage. Magnetic earphone are good when they are not in use the stick together making it free from getting tangled. Liked it.
2556,5.0,"When I review a product my first question I ask is that does it worth my money.... ?
And to this product my answer is that... More than 100 %.... I got it for 999 rupees so lucky.... And what more you want.... It is best product in the prize range of 1300 ruppees .... Then the rest is luck"
2557,5.0,"Bass is just amazing. Sound quality is decent but in this price no complains at all. Also battery life is amazing all tho it refreshes battery percentage after a restart only, if you stay connected for longer you will notice that battery percentage remains constant but it's actually decreasing."
2558,2.0,Not worth Rs.1699 that I paid. Sound quality is no better than others available at much lower price. Not useful for workout as well as it tends to fall off.
2559,4.0,"I got this yesterday, in amazon big sale at a good price of 999 only! I was searching for almost 3 months pocket-friendly and without losing the quality :). I am must this is it go for it you will no regret. they really rock. BTW my major use is listening to music than talking over the phone I am very happy."
2560,1.0,"Till yesterday it was working fine, but since today Morning when I have tried many times to turn on the neck band bluetooth ear phone, but it is unable to turn on. I dont knw what is the problem in the bluetooth. But when when I am putting on charge it is getting charge. Kindly replace my product. Thank you"
2561,5.0,"A great earphones by boAt Rockerz. The earphones is overall great. But if you are buying this earphones for playing pubg I may recommend not because the mic speaker is so low that the other pubg players gets our sound really low. If you are buying this earphones for music, travel, movies etc then go for it."
2562,1.0,"Just after 3 days of the purchase, I had to request for the replacement because their charging panel got overheated & melted.
I got my replacement pretty fast, but again after 10 days earphones stopped working.
My suggestion would be not to go for this earphone & save more to get better earphones."
2563,1.0,Worest product I am not using. West of money. Doing any call other person trolld me.previyos I had used rocker's 250 nice cansilation and quality very good on bike driving it's dropped some where
2564,4.0,nice device and easy to connect and features also good. suitable for big ear hole
2565,4.0,Sound quality as expected from boat is awesome. but lower sound then other brand. the biggest problem i am facing with is connecting with dual devices. while connected with a phone and a laptop it takes time to switch from one device to other and you can receive calls while connected to duel devices. rest everything is fine.
2566,5.0,there is nothing for dislike the best sound quality and best battery long last up to 9hrs if you play at normal volume for me in this amount this product is better than JBL..
2567,4.0,Good base. Good noise cancellation . Amazing at this price. Only issue is the Bluetooth connectivity. Keeps disconnecting Randomly. Gets irritating while gaming.
2568,1.0,"The product isnt half bad when it works. Seamlessly connects and plays audio with decent isolation. Then it stops working after 20 days. First the left one goes, then the right, then it plays music intermittently till it stops altogethers. Product is a joke."
2569,4.0,it not worked in my laptop. Please provide it software.
2570,5.0,Go ahead and buy...using for more than 6 mnths ...no issues
2571,1.0,"Please dont purchase it..its plastic n rubber quality is not good its hard.
Even the ear buds are not comfortable at all u can't wear it for more then 1 hour. Your ears starts paining. I won't suggest it all.and no replacement also. Purchase infinity its far more better then boat rockers."
2572,5.0,"This is really a great product. I am using this product for the past 2 weeks and it is really working well. It allows me to attend Calls, FM (by adding additional FM app), Musics and videos."
2573,3.0,price wise nice coz i purchased for 999 rs and its light weight and sound is ok not good and i purchased it for running so it fits best on ears and proper design wid lenth all things are best bt sound is some how ok bt price also matters
2574,5.0,"Stylish, great design, fits perfectly and is comfortable. Sound is really good quality. Value for money. boat Rockerz ROCKS !!!! 🙂"
2575,1.0,"Im writing the review after using 5months
Sound Quality was good and battery backup also fine but when i used after 5months suddenly its stopped working
i bought 1900bucks its not worthy
Guys go for another one , We cant spend 1900bucks for just 5months of usage"
2576,5.0,"This is simply excellent!! Sound quality is very nice, with the bass added it's even more better. Nose cancellation too is very good. Microphone works like a charm. I am using it for my business meetings and calls, and it's Crystal clear..
It's an excellent product for 1000/-"
2577,1.0,Till now I have complained about it 3 times to Boat company and get this product replaced ( thry are returning someone's headphones to you) but still it is giving issues. I am going to puty complaint again... Pathetic device and service by boat... It was not expected by boat...!!!
2578,4.0,"Sound quality is good enough but only problem I faced is that the earbuds which came along it start hurting after about an hour of usage. Rest nice connectivity, durable, nice noise cancellation and nice Bluetooth connectivity."
2579,1.0,"My boat rockerz got dysfunctional in just a month. I don't know whether I got defected piece or what but its speakers are not working now in just a month. this is really annoying. All my money is wasted. Also, I don't have a returning option now. This is not accepted from such a big brand boat and amazon."
2580,3.0,Can't be connected to 2 phones at the same time. There is distortion in audio while you are moving. But overall a decent product.
2581,1.0,"Do not buy.
The product stopped working all of a sudden.
The contact information provided of the manufacturer and seller is false. And no one responds. Amazon ask to go on Google and search the alternative details.

Amazon also is not able to help in this matter."
2582,5.0,"Sound clarity is good, bass is loud enough, battery backup lasts for 12-15 hrs if used continuously, with low usage (only calls) it works for 2-3 days and is very lightweight."
2583,2.0,"Bass and the audio quality is really comparable to big brands. However, durability is a concern. The first pair I had had some issues with right earphones. The replacement had issues of voice breakage. Sooner or later, the boat sinks... I went for JBL Endurance Run BT."

2621,2.0,"Sound is good n decent , wire is too large not required that much infat it reaches till stomach, doesnt have vibrations for call notifications. Built Quality is good."
2622,2.0,"Sound quality is good but the mic is pathetic. Leaving your own voice the mic would catch everything else. So I won't recommend this earphones for taking the calls. If you want to listen to songs then they are good, rest don't buy them.

Also, they are painful while in ear so you can't use them for long time."
2623,2.0,"Good till it was working, lasted a whole 5 months

Great bass and good sound quality.
Was getting decent battery backup also.

Suddenly, refuses to charge
As soon as it is connected to charger shows full charge, but can't be used for more than 1 min"
2624,4.0,I used this for 3 months and then the right side of the earphone stopped working so I raised a ticket at boat website they took my earphones for replacement but after that they just stop replying to my emails and the toll free number will connect even if you try 100 times a day.
2625,1.0,"Bought in July 2019, hardly used for 15 -20 days. Stopped charging and when tried with a different charger charged hoti 40 percent in an hour but on usage became 20 percent with 5 min of use. After that turns super hot when I connect to charger. Total waste of money."

2629,2.0,Not a good one though.. dont take it by looking at the reviews. It dont have bass. And even if u need to pick the call while riding bike forget this.. and the sound is not at all good quality. U ll feel exactly like like Samsung's basic earphones

2633,5.0,"First when I bought this for 1500 I received defective product.....I requested return nd refund nd got refunded in no time... then I ordered this during freedom sale and got jz for 799[cashback]...when u love bass jz go for it. Sounds same like apple wired buds

Amazing earphones jz go for it"
2634,4.0,"That sound which it makes while starting up is irritating. I am pretty much satisfied with battery life and sound quality. The built quality is also good. But the thing is none of these matters of your Bluetooth connectivity is not good , it was pretty average I was expecting a bit more good connection."
2635,4.0,"I bought this headphone in August 2019. It was working perfectly fine in the beginning but within a few days of using, it's microphone stopped working. Would not recommend anyone to buy this.
This claims to have a 1 year warranty. But the stores deny to provide service of anything purchased online."
2636,5.0,"Design 4.5/5
Bass5/5
Battery 4.5/5
Build quality 4/5
Only bad thing is charge indicator is worst it shows 100-80-60-0

2637,1.0,"#BadExperience with #boAtRockerz255
Bluetooth Headphones has stopped working in just 2month. It is connecting to device but there's no sound coming in either side ear plugs

I bought it in sale for 999/- . Seems Damaged product is delivered during Amazon sale

#DonotBut"
2638,1.0,What the hell is this purchased last day and found some local boat earphone now no one helpine me. Very bad experience
2639,4.0,"Comfort level could be higher..
Bluetooth connectivity with laptop is an issue which needs to be resolved."
2640,5.0,The Earphones are a good buy for this price range. The noise cancellation during calls is quite good and so is the connectivity. Battery roughly supports for a whole day use on its moderate usage. Good buy considering everything. Totally satisfied and would recommend to others.
2641,5.0,"Original,exact colour matched,nice bluetooth connectivity,noise cancellation is very good,super grip with ear even when you are running or doing exercise,easy operations.Sound quality is also up to the mark at this budget level.I just loved it."
2642,4.0,"Pros
1. looks stylish
2.Great sound quality
3. Good Battery
4.Ergonomic design.

Cons
1.irritating announcement every time you connect/disconnect or Power on/off the device a small beep would have been fine for me.
2.not exactly a con but latency is a little high so if you are thinking to play games while wearing this be prepared for the lag."
2643,1.0,"Product does not charge properly. Sometimes even after connecting to usb, it does not start charging. Moreover, when battery is lower than 20% it turns off automatically."
2644,5.0,"Bass 9/10
Vocal 8/10
Comfort 9/10
Bluetooth connectivity 10/10
Battery Backup 10/10
Over all great product. 👍

P.S Sometimes it won't work properly on calls."
2645,5.0,"Awessome!!
Good sound than expected.. Good noise cancellation... Comfort in ear and mic is also good for calls...
Worth for price below 2k.. I bought it for 1500"
2646,5.0,All the features listed make it a very desirable earphone for me. But thing which is not mentioned here and I found out about it only on arriving is its dual connectivity. It is able to connect to my laptop and phone simultaneously and I need not have to use a separate earphone. I liked this dual connectivity feature very interesting to me.
2647,3.0,There is no noise cancellation. In a call other side person here your sourding voices clearly rather than yours. Don't buy if you are using for Calls.
2648,4.0,"Nice headset. Good sound ,noice cancellation, handy, good battery. One thing is with the mic. Some times the surrounding noice is boosted more while making calls and audio recording. Rest all nice."
2649,5.0,Nice quality and sound is so crispy and clear bass is very good. I like it very much... battery life is excellent. I use it whole day without charging...my phone is connected withit whole day playback time is nearly 8 hours.
2650,2.0,2 star simply because even though product is good it's design causes a lot of pain in ear fitting. Hence forth makes it unsable for people like me who can't use hook type buds. So for all those who have same problem don't buy it for sure because it has no return policy only replacement one
2651,4.0,"Best for music. For calls, Noise cancellation doesn't work 100% during rides / outside which is kind of expected.
In closed places connectivity & sound quality is good. Connectivity may be 5 - 6 metres. Fares around 6 - 7 hours on fully charged. Overall satisfied for my requirement."
2652,1.0,I have purchased device and with in 2 Month Battery backup is zero. Don't go for this product these guys are fooling there customers.
2653,1.0,It's a cheating guys..battery is not charging just in one month of buying..and battery drains withing one hour of usage.
2654,5.0,"Its a better product among all the wireless headphones, very light, and even afater using for hours and hours you don't feel pain in ears"
2655,5.0,"Long lasting battery, fastest connectivity, awesome sound, durable build, voice assistant... A complete package. Worth the buy. I have 6 headphones,3 of them are boat. this is best so far"
2656,1.0,The quality is horrible. It stopped working after 3 months. Typical Chinese quality products that are completely unreliable. This company just imports products from China and sells them in India with a different brand name. Stay away from boAt products if you attach any value to your hard earned money.
2657,1.0,"I have brought my ear phone or baot Rockers 255 sports on 12/6/19 .
But with in 2 months is not working
The helpline no or customer care of boat nirvana they are not picking up the phone
& I have email them but they are not responding to this also
Please help me as soon as possible"
2658,4.0,Good sound quality. Zero bluetooth lag. Bass is nice but still could have been better if sound was more crisp. But probably could done with a good equalizer.
2659,4.0,Sound is good quality in manufacturering is also good bluetooth working smoothly not find any connectivity issue....I got this approx ₹1100 on sale on amzone....In my apponeion it's good product till ₹1500.but it's not good after that price.go with tagg inferior if u have more money to invest in Bluetooth earphone.
2660,4.0,"best use within 0-15 m range, beyond you might face a voice drop in between. overall a good product. But not prefered for long time usage, because you might face pain in ear's i am not sure either it's because of built or material they provide. Will recomended for base lovers."
2661,4.0,"Got it for 999 . It's a decent BT head set build is not premium but it's ok .

Charg remains for a day with medium usage. ."
2662,1.0,Don't go with the price I used it and after 4 months only right side is working. I wrote to boat about my issue and they simply gave me the address of their service centre in Karol bagh. Is this a joke!!! Seriously. Don't go with price boat is clearly not worth it.

2666,4.0,Sound is good.. Bass is also good.. Noise cancelation is also good but it does not look good because of lengthy hanging cords by side.. So I will suggest u to go for boat rockerz 261..

2670,5.0,"Boat 255 it was awesome product this product regular price is 1,499 but Republic Day shopping I got only 999..... Superb and Wonderful Experience thank u Amazon....."
2671,5.0,"Reasonable price, comfortable and sound quality is really great, bass is also good. Connectivity is also good."
2672,5.0,The boat usually have a great sound quality especially in Bluetooth segment I have 3 models of boat Bluetooth earphones all 3 are best on sound quality.
2673,4.0,"Good build, nice sound, very easy to connecy, very good battery backup BUT one major problem is poor microphone. Other party feels problem in hearing clearly. Otherwise, as a non calling earphone, very satisfactory"
2674,3.0,"Pros:

-gives at least one day battery life.
Cons:
-not comfortable in ears, getting unplugged while walking. so design need to improve.

if this issues are resolved then it would be value for money product."
2675,2.0,"My Boatrockerz is showing technical issue, it's gets disconnected frequently automatically, low in sound and sometimes it shows that it's connected but sound gets on loudspeaker system automatically.

It might pop out in the starting days but will eventually start getting the grip."
2677,4.0,I've been using these headphones for almost 2 months now. The sound quality is really good. Good battery back up 7-8 hours. The fit of the earphone is good and I use it daily while working out. If you are looking for a good wireless earphones under 1.5 k then this is the one.

2683,5.0,"Super, noice cancellation was awesome. And sound quality super. Connectivity is around 15mtrs. I checked it. Pls listen 8d audio songs to know the product specifications. And battery was 5-6 hrs approximately. Worth of money. Buy it"

2685,2.0,"Sound Quality is average, Battery last for 4-5 Hours of playback, major drawback is Bluetooth range is as weak as let's say 10Mtr Max Other one is this Bluetooth Headset interfering with my WiFi I changed channel of wifi and everything but couldn't help.

2689,2.0,"Sound quality is above average on these earphones, however, I hate the voice commands coming in from them. Especially when the. Attery is low. It yells, ‘Oops! Batter low’ in my ear after every minute. It’s extremely irritating. I wish there was an option to disable that."
2690,4.0,Good product @ 999₹ but battery life is 2 days only after heavy use bass is very good & call clarity is also good
2691,1.0,Product is good but it stopped working after 1 year 15 days. Exactly 15 days over 1 year of warranty. Now its just piece of junk of no use. Don't got for Bluetooth as higher risk of malfunctioning.

2701,5.0,"Its a beast at this price point. I was opting for some other brand but one fine morning I saw this in offer and had a brief research which instantly changed my mind and without second thought I opted this one.
Loved the noise, bass, noise cancellation and it's very handy."

2703,4.0,"Sound is clear & loud

2705,5.0,Very good sound clarity with bass. The neck band is very flexible. You do not have to worry about handling. It looks like it would withstand rough use to a good extent.

2706,5.0,"bass is nice but voice clarity is 8 out of 10, overall is nice, battery last of 4 hours of continuous use. otherwise it will last for whole day. if u dont like too much bass then its not for u, go for synheizers then"

2710,4.0,Works well normally. But every now and then the sound goes quiet for a second and then becomes loud. Some software glitch
2711,4.0,"Product overall is good, but the call quality could have been better.
Person on the other side is not able to hear most of the times and you have to speak very close to the receiver on the Bluetooth so that the other person can hear properly.
Sound quality is good, on the base heavy side."
2712,5.0,"Using this product for about a month now. Pros: Good Sound Quality, Noise Cancellation, Decent quality of conversation when you talk to someone in phone.
Cons: Only concern is about battery. It drains too fast and Low battery indication starts when battery is 40%. And it drains within 5-10 min"
2713,4.0,Its been a month now... First of all its a neckband wireless in the ear headphone.. The sound is more like boat basshead 255..i have used 255 earlier.. Battery backup is probably 5-6 hours.. i got it in sale at 990.. And at this cost Its worth it...
2714,1.0,"One earbud stopped working after two weeks. Registered a complaint at boat. They took the product and no further response, waiting approx for a month."
2715,1.0,After using 3 months I found its battery lasts only for 30 minutes. It is poorest ever headphone. Can you please suggest me where should I claim its warranty from? As its battery lasts only for 30 minutes now after using 3 months.
2716,5.0,"Best in its Class..bought it for 999/-, it's a good product by Boat..I suggest to blindly go for it..no regrets so far.."
2717,1.0,"With in three months it's NOT charging & is NON functional.
I demand a working paid as replacement."
2718,4.0,"I got it @ ₹ 1999 and after one month of use I can say it's an ok type product.

Worth for money

Sound quality is good, but cannot be compared with what JBL provides."
2719,1.0,I bought this 1 and a half month back and now the Sound quality and Bluetooth become so bad that clarity in call and music degraded drastically. I Live lin Bangalore North and service centre is in South Bangalore (which is more than 2 hours drive) In a city like Bangalore they just have once service centre. I don't recommend as their after-sales services are very bad.
2720,2.0,Just been an year... And the device stopped working properly and there is break in the sound and one of the speaker doesn't work completely. Found it to be defective in it's functionality.
2721,3.0,Sweat or water easily getting in to this button gaps and gaps in neck band sweat easily getting into through gaps its stops working i have exhanged twise but no use i cont use it for two days .Sound quality Bass awesome have to improve Durability.
2722,2.0,"Rating dekh ke samajh jao.. 3 month ke bad right wala speaker band Ho Gaya,Jo ears mein rubber cork Lage hote hain vah bar bar nikal jaate Hain bass quality itni acchi nahin hai. Total timepass product hai. Quality bhi theek theek hain. Agar koi option ho to ese na Kharide"
2723,1.0,If I have something below 1star I would definitely gone for that.. the worst product ever..!! Experiencing the same issue repeatedly.. malfunction of right side speaker.. they promised for an replacement but they repaired the product and given it to me.. the worst ever..!!
2724,1.0,"Don’t buy this product in sale, instead of giving boat rockerzz 255 sports they gave me boat rockerzz poor quality of hardware material, battery. This is not expected from amazon. I used boat rockerzz 255 twicely and can be understand the differance between both earphones."
2725,1.0,Sound quality and connectivity are okay. But the quality of the product is below average. I got my product broken down within 3 months. So I recommend don't spend 1000+ rupees on a unsure product
2726,1.0,"Zero noise cancellation, mic is also poor. Only good to hear music."
2727,5.0,"First of all boat never disappointed me, I'm the customer since 2 years. Sound quality is awesome, noice cancellation is too good, and about bass which is really mean to me you made it rocking. Thank you so much"
2728,1.0,"Boat Customer care service is a concern as even after 50 tries their website is saying ""OOPS..."" message only to log the call.
No way to talk their customer care officers over phone call. My Bluetooth Boat Roeckers 255 is faulty now, as its left earbud not working, no clue how to get support."
2729,4.0,"Bluetooth connectivity and noise cancellation is fine.
sound quality is good but bass is very high which is harm your ears.
Design is not bad but I recommend that type of neckband in which earphones wire behind the neck.boat earphones wire are in front of your face that can irritate you."
2730,3.0,Quality of sound is good not best..noise cancelation is too bad so many complaints who is receiving my calls no clarity in conversation....IAM only using for songs listening and mostly not fitting in my ear properly my ear in pain while using just 10 to 15mins..need smooth quality for that issue .
2731,1.0,"This is waste product, please don't buy and suffer. Headset is not working i went for replacement also, i didn't get even i didn't get fr ee service, they mentioned simply warranty..don't believe and don't buy any products in amezon.we don't have the options for customer service also."
2732,1.0,"Very poor quality, it's not safe also, when we use our ears are paining due to the sound. Unable to talk more than 10 min. Also bluetooth connectivity is very poor. Always disconnects. Don't buy."
2733,4.0,"For voice calls the in ear buds make it difficult to hear our own voice when talking.
For music is good."
2734,4.0,"Good sound but Bluetooth connectivity have issues, if my phone is in my jeans pocket then the songs voice drops and skips as like there is a connectivity failure."
2735,4.0,"This is my 1st Time experience With boat rockerz And It was Great
(1)Noise Cancellation Is better 90%
(2)Sound Quality is Awesome
(3)For Working out it's good for Walk In ear Complete Fit
(4)Bass Is slightly Better then the JBL
In this price It was Good Products By Boat Surely Go it"
2736,4.0,If you want to purchase best headphone under 1500Rs so it is a best product. Sound quality is so good but but wire is long so when i running on the track then it create a problem but another quality is so good............
2737,1.0,The battery wears off in few hours of playback which is very disappointing. Now I can't even return the product as the return window is closed.
2738,3.0,This is very simple earphones. No stereo sounds no Eco sound no deep base bass as well as not much more Cristal sound. If this earphones rate has 500rs then it will be good. Rate is very high not performance according to price. I can’t recommend for any one but this product is Normal pls do not exite for this.
2739,3.0,It's an average product .bought it for 999 so it's okay .I get complains of noise most of the time from the other end
2740,1.0,"Things were going good, until recently one of the speakers not working properly.
Good product overall but It is not suited for rought use."

2743,5.0,"The boat rocker 255 ear phone sound quality is really good. Base is acceptable range, Call quality and noise cancellation are superb."
2744,4.0,"Nice low cost best bluetooth headphones.
Neat sound and base
7 to 8 hrs battery life
Worth for the cost"
2745,1.0,Purchased in July 2019 and it's stopped working by the end of September 2019. Reason not known and I don't know to whom shall I contact?. Please help me.
2746,5.0,"Bass is too good and product quality is also good
Battery lasts long.
It has a little fit issue in ear but very light and easy to carry"
2747,4.0,"Got it for 900 after discount. And yes, it is worth every rupee I spent on it. You'll have the freedom from dangling wire and brocken jack joint."
2748,4.0,"Honestly speaking sound quality is not as expected, bass is good but rest all not so great,
Battery is not bad I get 6-7 hours
Durability is good,
Connectivity is not good, regular disconnection happens while you move few meters or while traveling which is not expected.
Overall I would rate this below 4"
2749,4.0,"Nice product value for money. Noise cancellation isn't that great, but considering the price, it's okay. Music quality and connectivity to phone is good. Overall nice product. Recommended if you are looking at something in this price range."
2750,4.0,"Iam fan of music, this bluetooth device is fantabulous, bass, noife cancellation,beats, are amazing.
While driving orwalking call voice clarity is low.
Battery back ip is good, call amd music 1 day i can use.
Go for it,
Starting i can buy or not
But now, no doubt, for it."
2751,3.0,"Battery got busted in 2 months the replacement, after 6 months stopped working as well. This earphone is totally overrated. The battery does not last the said amount and goes down from 100 to 80 to 60 to 0. After reaching 60% it constantly reminds battery is low and shuts down in a minute or two."
2752,3.0,"Actually it's a good product at this price compared to others.But not for people who likes to get immersed in music and enjoy every bit of every instrument and vocals in it in depth. So if you are such a person, go for other earphones but those will be costly."
2753,5.0,"Excellent time delivery with package.
Excellent product.
Excellent Sound quality
Excellent Bass effect
Bluetooth range is about to 10mtr.
Overall excellent"
2754,1.0,I purchased this product on 24.4.19. And it is not working today. I am jot able to connect it to any of my devices. It was working fine initially. Bit since last few days i am not able to connect it with my phone. I tried with other 4 different phones but i am not able to connect it.
2755,2.0,Connectivity is very poor. It's not seamless and instantaneous which you certainly expected out of boat. Not comfortable for ears if used for long hours. The plastic used seems to be of low quality in the neckband. Not a good purchase if you are buying it for more than 700-800 bucks.
2756,4.0,"This product is a perfect-buy especially in this price range. It has a very wide dynamic sound quality. The trebles are fabulous and the bass is also nice, although the bass could've been better. But overall, it is a very nice product and I'd definitely suggest everyone to go for it."
2757,5.0,Please go ahead and buy it now ..in 999 its very best product .forgot wire tension its so lengthy..use this Bluetooth ..paisa wasool..just there is one suggestion to boat please look in Bluetooth connectivity.
2758,5.0,In bbd its 900 ...its awesome... Good battery life ..as indian love bass so its give good bass..punches are okay ...easy to use ...no problem in ear as my ear are in big in size... although u get extra buds ..small medium nd large size...
2759,3.0,"For music it's good, but if u looking for Music & Audio call don't buy this products, barely ur voice deliver to other side, instead of ur voice background sound is more clear on call, need to work on noise cancellation feature of this product. I would recommend this product only for music purpose."
2760,5.0,"An awesome product. The day I put it in the ear, I was spellbound. The bass is good, the treble is good and the sound is crisp and clear. I am lucky that I picked it up at Rs.999. Loving it wearing around the neck all the time and I am now 60."
2761,5.0,"I bought it again for my friend.
This headset is very good at this price. Awesome bass and noise cancelation. It looks so sexy. This is a cheap and best wireless headset. I loved it ❤️.
Go for it blindly."
2762,5.0,"Noise cancellation is very good and with sweat\splash resistance , can be very well used during my workout. Battery is pretty good, 15-20mins of charging can last whole day and I'm using it heavily ( it's on and connected always with my OnePlus 7 ) ."
2763,4.0,Sound quality is good with a proper base. At this price noise cancellation feature and yes it's working. Moisture-wicking is not there
2764,5.0,"Really good Bluetooth headphones for sports activities, little range issue, I bought black ones I loved it. I need to charge it averagely after two days depends on the usage. I use it everywhere home, gym , office while travelling also calling really great for me so far."
2765,5.0,Best cost effective product that provides best sound quality and good features like splash resistance and 6 hrs battery life. The device has good punchy bass. Boat has built the device well but the material is not so premium. This device is best for guys who want to hear music while working out.
2766,5.0,Bass is really awesome. Treble is also good. You can listen to all the beats very clearly. Bought it in a deal at only 1000 rs. So totally worth it for me.
2767,4.0,"I bought them in a lightening deal from Amazon.at1000 bucks they are worthy. Bass is the main highlight of the BT earphones.
Battery life is satisfactory, Build quality is sturdy.
I am satisfied with the product."
2768,5.0,"I got this at Rs998 on Amazon Prime Sale.
Noice Cancellation is average
Sound Quality and Mic quality justifies the price.
Looks amazing
Super Comfortable
Battery backup is good works for 6 hours non-stop
Standby time is 1 day
Most Recomended at this price range"
2769,1.0,"Burst quality product. Charging points got damaged within two weeks for both sets.
Not advisable to buy. Waist of money.

Unable to download invoice from site as well Amazon app. No proper facility like in flip cart. Horrible service by Amazon. Please Add in your app for good service."
2770,3.0,"Noise cancellation is ok, but not that much I expected.
Bluetooth connectivity was very perfect up to 4 month and started to bluetooth connectivity having disconnection even me near the phone.
Sound & Bass quality is very perfect and right side volume decreases automatically some time."
2771,5.0,"It is a great product of its below 1000 category... Clear sound... With added bass enriching the music. ... Easy to carry.. no worries , just to put on neck...
A little drawback , it cannot be put much time in the ear, as because it goes inside the ear, and some time itching problem occurs."
2772,3.0,"Sometimes it disconnect automatically
And the ear bud sometime not comfortable for ears it pains after long hours
Rest it is good"
2773,4.0,After using it for more than a couple of months I would say it’s decent. Don’t expect an exceptional sound quality with this one. However something I didn’t expect was a good noise cancellation for an in ear headphone.
2774,5.0,"I'm using this product for more than a month, it's does its job.. Whatever mentioned on catalog works as expected.. Ready assured and go with this product..."
2775,1.0,"I got the product yesterday, and the battery was fully charged & on continoluous listening it lasted for 2hours which was still ok, but now when I kept it for charging for almost an hour, it is not getting charged."
2776,1.0,"I have purchased this product on 12 September 2019.
But just in two months both earphones are not-working. I tried for replacement from it's site they are more worse ever as I got irritated with their reply that my invoice of complaints is not correct."
2777,1.0,Bought this product 2 months back and right side is not functioning properly . Even tho the product is in under warranty no one is helping out to fix . Such a poor quality product and service
2778,5.0,"Sound quailty,naise cancellation and maister wicking,and google assetane feture are excellent.very good product,money worth product.I m so happy.but box little bit damage,but it is ok."
2779,5.0,Overall good product but if you need bass this is not the one. The rubber top weras off but it's great to use. I bought two of them and use it regularly with out any issues.
2780,5.0,"It has decent sound quality and battery life, the product feels delicate but no problems so far. This product is a good buy for the price"
2781,2.0,Sometimes power on is not working...without doing anything working. I don’t know what is the problem but not good.
2782,2.0,"Initially was quite good but within 4 months one of the ear buds stopped working and today the second one as well , I works if if I twist the wire and hold it in that way , no doubt it’s manufacture default and warranty has come of no use as no response is provided from the concerned boat organisation"
2783,4.0,"Its a good budget friendly Bluetooth earphone. And it looks and sounds good.
1. a little base boosted.
2. not impressed with the stereo width
3. Noice cancellation and fit is impressive.
4. And its not the 1st preference with out a deal."
2784,1.0,Worst earphones. It worked superb only for the first three months. Now they are gone. No service from boat. Pathetic. Never choose this earphones. It's been 10 days now and no one reached out even after registering a complaint. Useless.
2785,5.0,"Good Bass. I previously used Boult. When compared with this Boat Rockerz is much better.

Build quality is also very good..

I got in a sale at 1k."
2786,1.0,After using 20 days I'm reviewing this product...Battery life is not good..it lasting for only 1 hr after charged.. Automatically it dries...Don't buy go for a good product...Sound quality is good
2787,3.0,The sound quality and its bass deserves 5 rating but it's way too big to carry. The wire is too long which makes it look like I'm hanging a stethescope around my neck. Noise cancellation is n oh t good
2788,5.0,"In my opinion plz trust me in 1600 ruppe this is best product in sound quality, noice cancellation and best in fit and comfort..battery is also very good .. I used it 2-3 hour daily and charge it on fourth day and it also recharge very fastly"
2789,2.0,I returned as they were not loud and clear enough and too painful on ears due to high bass if played on a bit high volume. At low nothing is clear.
2790,5.0,"Best budget wireless neck bands. Loud sound, awesome Bluetooth connectivity...but one minus point, these earphones mainly focus on bass which makes the sound less clear, although you can customise it with Equalizer and stuff to make it great...but if you are bass lover then it's for you!"
2791,1.0,"dump earphones, right side fault"
2792,5.0,GOOD PRODUCT. APROX. 6 HOUR BATTERY LIFE ON FUUL VOLUME. BASS IS GOOD. CONFRTABLE. ONE ISSUE ITS NOT FOLDABLE OR PACKET CARRY.

2795,1.0,"Just a little con in this product and that is it has a few hours of bettery life, which they have already mentioned.
Purchased two of them one is in neon green and another one is red in color at same time.
Both the shipment were from different vendor & from different state and received in good state."
2796,3.0,After used 2 months I can say in 1400 rs this product is not good it's Bluetooth rang is so bad and its sound quality is not good if you want bt head phones than not purchased it.if you are music lover than purchased wired earphones only it has extrem level of voice quality.

2798,4.0,"I have been using this since couple of months now...

For price,brand, battery, life sound and connectivity...it hits the bull eyes.

U can definitely go with the product and enjoy the super cool experience."
2799,4.0,"A good purchase for this price. However, the bluetooth range is max upto 7 to 10 metres only. Sound quality is good and is sweatproof to a good extent. Battery life is just okay, not great. Little flaws here and there but one of my best purchases."

2807,3.0,"The headset was okay type. But the product build is kinda weak. The charger I received along with the headset was defective. It doesn’t fit to micro usb pin of the headset. Noise cancelling is poor.
Moreover pain in ears if you use it for more than 15mins"
2808,3.0,Nice product in price range but it's having problems with connectivity and battery live . Sound starts breaking when moved 20-30 feets from phone and battery drops from 60% to 20% in very quick time. Sound quality is very good

2811,4.0,"Ear adjustment isn't proper, during use it gets slip frequently after some time get irritated!
Battery backup is not so good,Max 3-4 hrs when fully charged
All other are better for this price range."
2812,1.0,This product has 1 pod defective and it is light wait ..... Realized this after the return day was gone and just compare the wait with another head phones for example compar it with black color boat rocker....it is good and cheap then red one so done buy this red boat rocker ....buy black onee
2813,5.0,"Would recommend going for the new Samsung or realme Bluetooth earphones in this price range. This product isn't bad at all infact it's really good, I bought this bcoz I got this for rs999 but if I were to to spend 1.5k then I would go for the Samsung or realme ones
Overall amazing product"
2814,3.0,"I bought these about 15 days back. The sound quality isn't all that great, great bass and average noise cancellation. The durability is the part that sucks the most, the battery gave up on me after being to the gym for just 7 to 8 times, which is disappointing. I had high hopes from this purchase but sadly, boAt let me down with this."
2815,1.0,"This earphone stops working within 6 months, replaced it twice, still same issue. firstly the left earpiece stops starting after some days even the right earpiece stops.
No doubt the sound quality is great and battery life of 6 hours.
Wiring quality needs to be improved."

2818,5.0,Really enjoyed it....only problem with delivery system....when I got this product there were no extra buds inside it and the packet was already opened by someone and also no bill reciept inside..... dissatisfied with amazon delivery service.....but this earphone deserves 5 🌟 ....
2819,5.0,"I got this headphone at Rs.899 and it is good headphone at this price. Sound quality is good and noise cancellation is also very good. U can hear good sound by keeping only 20% noise. But bluetooth connectivity is quite weak, it is connected upto 5-6 metres and not more than that."
2820,4.0,The treble in the song is sacrificed for increased bass. But it is really good considering the price. The built quality is also very good and feels premium.
2821,3.0,"Boat wireless is good but having only one issue, while calling or receiving calls, the sound breaks and cannot able to listen properly. This happens every time."
2822,1.0,only useful to listen music and watch movies. Very bad when making calls. people from other side can hear all the sounds around me but not my voice. its a total waste for making phone calls using this headset and other side always complaining about my voice
2823,3.0,"I bought this product on 16 July 2019 and now only side works.

I am bit disappointed with the malfunction of this product. Every things is fine with the price but I was not expecting it to work like this.

Now I am just listening from one side of the earphone."
2824,4.0,"Sound quality is very good as always Boat have, Super bass with balanced treble. Within this price range no other can beat boat. Go for it.
My 1st product has less treble and i replace that product and this is as expected. If you think sound is not upto the mark then replace your product."
2825,3.0,"My device is not being connected to Bluetooth. Please help where can I go and get it checked.
It worked perfectly for 2-3 days."
2826,5.0,Sound quality is good. But the bluetooth takes time to connect after turning on. They should reduce the connecting time.
2827,5.0,Very good sound quality. Worth buying. Enjoy watching TV and music in silence without disturbing others.
2828,5.0,"This is amazing ,noise cancellation works perfectly.If u want to invest for a good sound quality Buy Boat Wireless..! And the main part is it is anti fatigue to your ears."
2829,5.0,Works well with my op3t phone. Occasional small amount of disconnect may be because of bluetooth sync issue. works well most of the times.
2830,3.0,"Superb quality of sound and music some disadvantage is u can't play pubg with this sometimes there is noise when nearby to a mobile tower , battery percentage indication goes from 100,80,60,20 u won't know when ur battery is getting over,
About the seller the package was not up to Mark and box was already opened."
2831,3.0,"Seems like Chinese headphone.
Sound quality is very bad like cheap Chinese headphone.
Bluetooth disconnect random.
Battery backup is ok.
Microphone is not picking the good sounds."
2832,4.0,"Nice product but unhappy with Bluetooth connectivity when u kept ur mobile in pocket if intermidiately bag comes on our lap connectivity gets disconnected and while traveling time too disappointing a lot that's irretating thing with Bluetooth, when it's come to sound quality it's really nice."
2833,3.0,"I bought it on 1st May and now today on 8th Oct one of the earphones stopped working.
If you want to buy a durable Bluetooth headset, this is not the right one. Worked just for 5 months.
Be careful"
2834,5.0,"It's worth of every penny,
Buy on 899 worth it
Awesome sound quality ,good battery backup least 10 hr"
2835,3.0,"This is nice product. Although audio quality is not that great, but can't expect more in this price range. Noise cancellation is efficient and fits nicely in the ear drum. overall, I would recommend this one if you want to buy Bluetooth headphone under Rs 1500."
2836,5.0,"Good product but while playing games like free fire , pubg the sound may delay other wise it's perfect"
2837,5.0,Cool product i have purchased this product in sale for 900 bucks gr8 deal i like the headphones will now purchase boat rockerz 400 during sale. But only hassle for delivery and they also don't share the delivery partner address so person can self collect the product of required.
2838,3.0,"Sound quality is okay, bluetooth connectivity is not upto the mark, it get disconnected if your mobile is in another room and you are in another.
Battery life is very poor."
2839,4.0,Best bluetooth earphone available for the price . Battery is also good .If you listen music continuously 2 3 hr then it might drain quickly other wise it will last more than 4 hrs. Don't keep your expectation very high in this price range .
2840,4.0,"If one is looking for budget wireless earphone, they can purchase this. It takes around 2 hours to charge. It is comfortable to use. It has good magnet. Wire qualify around neck is ok."
2841,5.0,"I used Sennheiser Cx213, Cx180 and Cx275s, Jbl T100a,, Samsung ehs64,, But Honestly writing This Pair Of Earphones have amazing crisp, Built, quality,, Sound quality, Mic,, Combination Of Perfection.. Go For It without any Doubt,, Thank Me After That... 100percent Paisa Vasoool.."
2842,2.0,Not as expected. Battery life poor. Connecting to two devices as quite tedious. Battery%which shows on the phone is absolutely incorrect
2843,4.0,"Awesome
Sound quality top class, Bass is very smooth, Over all for listening it gives you very clear sound.
Money = worth it
And also service from official boat service centre is very good i like it."
2844,4.0,"A near ideal buy in Rs 999/-.
Sound quality might not be perfect but noise cancellation is really good. Light weight makes it perfect for on the go activities."
2845,4.0,"Have been using past 4 days. Wonderful earphones, worth every penny. Light weight.battery life lasts up to 7 hours of continuous music and calls on full charge. Sound quality can be improved."
2846,3.0,noise cancelling is not to the standard if you travel in trains and Bluetooth connectivity has some problem in railway station may be some thing is interfering
2847,5.0,"Other Boat headsets had poor bass and was very noisy at times. But this one stands out. It was nice listening to songs for long time. During voice calls, if u lie on right side and talk, voice gets stuck as the connectivity is getting disturbed. Dont know if its normal. Otherwise its a must buy...!"
2848,3.0,I am using this product from past few months. But now days is not working like before. Sometimes is lost connection.... Sometimes it's connected but not getting sound for few seconds. Besides that product is good.battery is too good. It giving is 5-6 hrs playback time
2849,5.0,"Good One from Boat. May be best bass at this price range.
I trust this brand cause of its service quality, Got this piece at Rs. 899 (During Diwali sale)."
2850,5.0,Good sound quality and very easy to connect with your cellphone. Offers you hansfree experience in true sense at the given price.
2851,3.0,"It was good at the begening but after using it for 15 days, the sound quality is not that good as expected and and feeling quite distubence in voice.. During the call, sound quality is very poor.. I would suggest choose different brand."
2852,5.0,Good product.i like it . useful .sound also clear and mic were good compare to other product i used...any way thankz to amazon .
2853,5.0,"Writing Review after using it For more than 25 days .
I Bought It For just Rs660 afte Cashback n all,
Bass is Too Good,
Sound is so loud,
Best buy, yoy must buy it if You are Bass lover,
Only issue is faced is noise cancelling is not so good but it is nice considering the price"
2854,4.0,"sound - great
connectivity - great
wire length - somewhat extra
carrying - a bit difficult since it is a bit bulky, though weight is quite less while wearing
look - great"
2855,5.0,Overall good. Nothing bad to say. As a gift the received party is so happy with the quality and performance. Good battery backup as well.
2856,5.0,"Used 2 months for 1-2 hour daily. Battery lasts upto 45-50 minutes only.
Worst battery backup. Sound is very good but it gets dead in short time so useless for me.
“Boat” u can take this back for free before i throw it out side of my window."
2857,4.0,Excellant sound quality with deep bass and noise cancellation. The ear holders are add-on for runnner and Jym goers. Battery last for 6 hours on continuous use. It charges very fast compares to other bluetooth earphones in the market.
2858,4.0,"Product quality is good , bass is very nice.
Little uncomfortable in ears specially while gymming with lot of sweat.
Neck Band little annoying while doing extensive workouts .
Otherwise sound quality is good
Will give 4/5 stars overall"
2859,5.0,"Being an audiophile, I always prefer good quality musical devices.. I had used boat headphones before and since then had decided to get the sport headphones .. excellent headphones. Received the product today.. I’m excited and very very happy !! Thanks !!"
2860,1.0,I purchased this in January...it was working good but now the right side ear piece is not working...i complaint on boat's official site for replacement...I got msg from company...but pickup boy is not coming...I'm calling him from three days...
2861,4.0,Basically Boat are giving a good quality products at the very good price range. This is one of the very good earphone for you available at this price (only genuine products). Only defect is connectivity range should've been more powerful.
2862,3.0,"Nice product... I'm using this product since October. But, I'm having connectivity issue within a month. There is no response from customer care even they don't pick your call."
2863,4.0,good product very good sound quality but the bass is little bit over
2864,1.0,It is not good product. Both the sound wings is damaged with in three month from buy a product. We cant raise complaints without invoice which is also not available for retrieve from side. Order delivered report is no co sided by merchant and hence replacement item is not customer friendly.
2865,1.0,"Bought this product for the 3rd time but again a bad experience. It works only 3-4 months after that it will stop working .
Really upset with the performance. Will never buy a Boat product again .
Dear Boat team , your product works only for 3-4 months . Please improve the quality"
2866,4.0,The plastic ear holders gets loose in a few days. The mic captures all ambient noise too much. This makes it harder for the listener. Otherwise an ok product.
2867,4.0,"Essay to connect, very light, battery back not checked completely but used 3 hours continue and not issue found."
2868,1.0,It's pathetic product bought in Nov 5 as on 13 it not working I sought for replacement they say their is no policy for the same I highly recommend don't buy this product. Got replacement that within 6months against same issue not working
2869,1.0,"Range of blue tooth connectivity is very less
Sound quality is ok
It's battery has only two modes
It will show 100% then 80% afterwards it will give an alarm for recharge."
2870,4.0,It is handy ofcourse very light weight. Sound quality is also good. Battery life also good didnt charged from yesterday. Only one defect on right hand side ear its earplug little bit pains while plugging in and out otherwise ok. And also right side quality is little bit low compare to left.
2871,5.0,"Honest Review. Has been using this product since 4 months , I am really very sattisfied with its sound quality. Mostly the battery backup is next level. With one single charge of 1&half hour i use for for aprox 2days without any problem and if unused then it backups upto 1week"
2872,3.0,"Music sound quality is good. But don't think to talk during Audio/video calls, there is lot of background noise that is audible to recipient. So not useful for talking on phone. I brought it for same purpose so not useful. But still sound quality, connectivity, back up is good."
2873,4.0,Perfect Bluetooth earphone at 1k. Sound quality & base is excellent only problem is batter life. But it's ok if you look at the price
2874,2.0,Boat customer support and service is so bad and never connect to their support services number.Don't buy this product.2 times got replaced.First mic got complaint and second time charging port got complaint.Second time they gave me a used product and it's one ear is not working also.Poor customer support and service.
2875,4.0,Good product value for money only drawback is they don't have a service center.. so use and throw...
2876,3.0,"Good battery backup.
Fast charge.
Better sound clarity.
But while jogging or running you will find it difficult to connect with the source , and the music stream breaks."
2877,5.0,"couldn't have been better, very light, very good build quality. feels almost no weight. very good value for money"
2878,4.0,"It has got enough bass and good sound clarity.battery last photo 6hrs,but for chatting it takes around 2.15 hrs.hurts your years if use it continues for more than 1.5 hrs.good for jogging and workout,.But dont use it in busy roads cause you cant hear most of the things happen ing outside once you plug in them"
2879,5.0,"Nice in ear headphone by boat. I am happy to use and can connect with my laptop as well as mobile.
I tested it while driving a 2 wheeler and still the mic quality was very good."
2880,1.0,Either I'm one of the few unlucky ones or they have a many fake good reviews. I had a torrid experience with these earphones. Have sent it back to bOAT 3 times in the last 4 months. Buttons randomly stop working. Mic doesn't work. Battery gets fried randomly. You never know when it'll just stop working. Not reliable at all.
2881,3.0,"Noise Cancelation is not good, i was at home and while picking up call, others could hear horns honking from outside my building

Also to mention i got a tampered package, but everything was working fine, so didn't plan to return it."
2882,5.0,"Got it yesterday,r really loved the product.. awesome sound.. i was thinking to buy the Airpod but a friend suggested this to me.. Why spend so much!! So i ordered this and this really is amazing.. it looks good.. have great sound and doesnt hurt ua ears!! I am totally satisfied with this."
2883,1.0,"The battery does not even last for 2 hours.
After charging it shows 100% n suddenly 20%
Not expected from BOAT"
2884,4.0,good 1 for music lovers
2885,5.0,"To say truth,sound quality is really awesome as expected. Clear and Cristal sound. Bass is superb.Coming to battery life,batttery life is also great once full charge not to worry for entire whole day. Regards to durability, I have not used for so long, so no idea. But the built quality really good so can be durable for long time."
2886,5.0,"Boat is a great brand. I have earlier purchased headphones of boat it's awesome, data cable- that's fabulous. And now this, battery life is good- charge it once it's enough for a day. Good for listening music, for talking, very convenient and premium design."
2887,4.0,Nice product Battery Can Be more improved it last for 5 hr. In a single charge with 100% volume. Decent Sound and nice bass instead Of buying these I would prefer to buy Realme Air Buds those are around 1700 but have a AWESOME Battery Life and great sound quality.
2888,4.0,"GREAT EARPHONES FOR THE PRICE POINT BUT THE MICS ARE DAMN SENSITIVE! THEY WOULD PICKUP EVEN THE LOWEST OF THE SOUND AND MAKES IT UNBEARABLE WHILE CALLING! THATS THE ONLY THING WRONG WITH THIS EARPHONES,OTHER THAN THAT GOOD PAIR OF EARPHONES. DONT BUY THEM IF YOU WANT CALLING ALSO!"
2889,3.0,It's a nice product as it has good battery life and it's quite light in weight but when it comes to sound section it is quite subtle and the bass too punchy but I liked the factor that it has magnet on earphone that connect together while hanging. Go for it if it's under ₹900.
2890,3.0,"Looks are good but the controls on the headphone not working as expected. When youtube is played on mobile and tried to play or pause with headphone control, just the 'Pause' action works but when the same button is pressed to play the video again, it does not play the video."
2891,5.0,"Best product until fourth month..after that a right ear piece fails to produce noise after 10 days left side ear piece also fails...i really like the product of boat,I already have wired boat headset which work really nice..then I buy a Bluetooth on the same hope..but makes my hope unfair..."
2892,4.0,"It's been 2 months since i started using this and right now in facing Bluetooth connectivity problems, this can be solved by switching ON the Bluetooth again .
Nose cancellation it's superb.
Battery backup is quite good
Design quality can be improved
Overall it's a good product"
2893,3.0,Good product. Great sound n battery life. Nice fit in ears.. The Bluetooth range is less.. About 5m only.

2916,3.0,"Not satisfied with the product. Sound quality is not at all good. I bought these because these were in my budget. Go for a better brand if you want to have a long term durability. Or, buy it at discount. I don't feel they are worth it for Rs.

2917,4.0,"Good product in this price.
Sound is good with decent battery life.
Voice calling is also good."
2918,1.0,"No warranty. No revert from their side even after writing a number of emails. Their site doesn't list it's model number to complaint about it. I bought 2 but in a span of 3 months, both stopped working. Worst company....they don't stay on their words."
2919,4.0,"Just received. First impression, the bass is too much that it suppresses the treble. Sometimes it hard to understand what the singer is saying due to excessive bass. Its a great buy for someone who loves bass. I'll give it a pass, will gift to someone."

1. Once got disconnected it doesnot connect again when in range automatically. Everytime manual connection is required to be set.

Bass,
Con
Battery life 5-6 hours for continuous use"
2928,5.0,"I am using it from last one year, the sound quality is good and the only problem is noise cancellation, there is no feature in it for noise cancellation. When u were travelling or at noisy place , u cant talk on calls using it, the outside sound will irritates the opponent."
2929,3.0,"I bought these earphones in the third week of January 2019. They worked great for more than 5 months and now they have stopped working from 1st July, 2019. I was just listening to songs and a weird sound 'chhuchik' came from right earphone and it is not turning on from then."
2930,4.0,Good sound quality for its price.. appreciable bass.. sound quality could be better.. But it's okay.. You get what you give..
2931,4.0,best budget wireless earphones. bass heavy (as expected from boat) above average clarity. mic is also average. getting a little over 5 hours of battery life with constant usage. hate the fact that for the last 10-15% it keeps on saying low battery every couple of minutes.
2932,4.0,"This is definitely worth Rs. 1500. Bass is heavy, but not of the best quality. Sound quality for the price is also decent. While the fitting feels comfortable and battery life is decent. I'd suggest you put in an extra 500 and buy Sony's wi c200."
2933,5.0,Really the boat is the best bluetooth earphone at this price and the sound was loud.bass is good and the battery backups is upto 5 hours at full sound its good bluetooth earphone
2934,1.0,Worst product I ever purchased. Initially it was okay. It was disconnecting automatically every 2 to 3 hours. Even though I reset. It's not a worthy product to recommend. When I realized it's performance worst the return duration got finished. So now I'm just bearing it. Poor quality and very poor sound.
2935,5.0,Built quality is good. Plastic material is good. Controls and Bluetooth connectivity is good. Good battery backup.

Please DONT buy BOAT products"
2938,4.0,"Bluetooth connectivity is not as expected. However, it is a good buy under ₹800. Not more than that. Bass is boosted but that appears to me exaggerated. It suppresses actual sound. Everything with these earphones appears exaggerated and fake. There is no naturality with these earphones."
2939,4.0,Worth 900 bucks. Works well with google voice assistant. Sound quality is good but feels bit fragile.
2940,3.0,"Sound quality is good battery is good but only issue is mic sensitivity, during call people recieving voice always complain that more than my voice surrounding sound is more hence you have to switch from bluetooth to phone for normal quality of calls."
2941,2.0,"its a good product ,but after one month one ear side is not working,after buying a quality product again we facing a problem ,y we have to buy & pouring 1500rs for this products,waste"
2942,3.0,"Music was awesome but I didn't like the Noice which was generating around. People are complaining on call that they are hearing different voices and disturbances. If you want music then go for this, But don't go if you want to talk on this."

Cons.
Bud could become a problem as it is not upto the mark."

2947,5.0,Such an awesome product. I loved it. Its value for money. Battery life was too Good. And Bluetooth connectivity very speedy. While driving it's very useful. For money it's worthy.
2948,1.0,Mid and low are severely suppressed... after a point of time you start feeling sick... when you turn your head to the right it disconnects...
2949,1.0,VERY POOR SOUND QUALITY..NOT AT ALL SATISFIED.There are Bluetooth wireless earphones available within range of Rs 200-300 with good sound quality than these earphones.

2971,3.0,"Sound experience was not so good if u switch from high quality earphone like samsung level u , u definitely dont like that....but its ok for normal user. There is no bass in it....so u cant expect more from this price range of earphone. I m not satisfied with it."
2972,4.0,So I got these earphones to play pubg and also listen to music..... These bad boys nailed it... The sound quality is pretty amazing and the bass is just😍.. I am not yet sure about the build quality but it doesn't seem so reliable...but if you can use them carefully... Just go for it.
2973,5.0,"Got it today, really loved the product.. awesome sound.. i was thinking to buy the Airpod but a friend suggested this to me.. Why spend so much!! So i ordered this and this really is amazing.. it looks good.. have great sound and doesnt hurt ua ears!! I am totally satisfied with this."
2974,4.0,Some times am facing connectivity issues.. Not getting connected to both phone and other device in dirst attempt.. Its little upsetting when i have to spend time to get it connected or even detected.. Also checked if the phone has BT issues using other devices.. But its not the case..
2975,3.0,"The Bluetooth connectivity is poor... Battery life is like not 100% becoz once it reaches 20% it starts giving warning... ""Oops battery low"" 2-3 times and then gets switched off completely.... So battery percentage use is only 80%. Sound quality is Good.... Over all ""average product""."
2976,5.0,"Sound quality is good, the bass beats is fine. But if your looking for a fine one this is not there one to choose. The product is wonderful, battery life is awesome."
2977,1.0,"No quality of sound. Ordinary earphones are working better than this product. No stereophonic effect.
No noise cancellation."
2978,1.0,After a few days of use the product stopped charging. The service center told the lid is not charging and cannot be replaced. Now without charging the headphone is useless
2979,2.0,"It's been almost 9months that I have been using the product, though not extensively. To my utter surprise, now the headphones only come to light when put to charge, as soon as the charger is disconnected the headphones conk off!"
2980,4.0,Bluetooth connects but calls are not heard sometimes. Battery life is average. Looks good and plasticky but premium.
2981,5.0,boAt Rockerz 255 bluetooth wireless earphone is simply superb. Quality of sound is awesome with extra deep bass. Noise cancellation and true HD sound. 4-5 hrs battery backup. If you want decent sound quality and extra bass then boAt rockerz 255 wireless earphone is the best.
2982,3.0,"All is good but connectivity is poor,when u are talking with anyone by bluetooth earphone than voice is break that time and there is no service center for future repair service so please don't buy such product"
2983,4.0,"Great battery backup..
Good Sound quality ..
Noise cancellation is good
Poor mic quality..

More trebble..
Decent base.
Best for 1k price."
2984,2.0,"The device will automatically get disconnected when the battery comes down to 60 to 70%.

Battery life is not sufficient, and will not be used completely.
The device will be used only for 30 to 40% of the battery usage.

Not satisfied as expected."
2985,2.0,"i buy boAt Rockerz 255 , after 6 months the Bluetooth headphones are not working .they are totally off , 1 month before left channel was not working and now both right n left channel are not working . now I'm not sure that the product by Amazon was original or duplicate ."
2986,3.0,"Calls have disturbance and sometimes not. Not sure why. However, I am keeping it to use for music only. If you are buying for calls then buy something else."
2987,1.0,Dear all I request you all please don't buy it please its worst Bluetooth earphone I ever bought . after only 2-3 months it's one side stop working and there is no noise cancelation at all
2988,3.0,I like the boat rockerzz 255 connectivity is good but rubber/fabric/plastic material is getting wear within 3 months. Dont buy like this headset.I raised an complaint but from the company no response received till now.
2989,5.0,"Superb earphone, built quality is awesome, very flexible, good battery backup, all are good but while playing pubg my team mates are not able to hear my voice, don't know it's the problem in pubg, earphone or my phone."
2990,4.0,"It feels light and comfortable while wearing. Sound quality is ok ok. I use it during workout so that's not much issue for me. Feels biased towards bass. I had to use equaliser to dial it down.

Don't buy if you are fussy about sound quality..."
2991,2.0,"The mic quality is really bad..the person on other side keep complaining that my voice is breaking.This is very frustrating.After 4 months of normal use (no sports or gym involved) ,right side has stopped working completely.The battery says 80% when you plug into a device,the very next moment it says battery low."
2992,4.0,"Very good noise cancellation. Good bass.
Using since August 19.. Really good. A lil bit connectivity problem due to older ver. Bluetooth of 255"
2993,3.0,I am consistently using boat products since last 2.5 years but some how i am get to know that it's lossing quality day by day my current purchase of these 255 wireless handsfree's left side port is totally off now say what can i do.... It's only 4 month of use
2994,5.0,Sound quality is excellent.. noise cancellation is good! & Connectivity is good! Battery life is extremely good... I full charged it & used upto 11-13 hrs non stop... Happy by the battery life
2995,1.0,"Even though the sound quality is good but what's the use of its going mute in middle of an audio.

Battery drains from 40% to 0% before a single song could finish it's lyrics.

But I have to say it was very good to use in the beginning/ when it was new."
2996,5.0,bass lovers really gonna kiss it but not like the build quality n ear hooks are not that sofisticated it hurst the ears after 25 to 30 mins you cant just plug into the ear n cant just forget .
2997,3.0,Boat rockerz are really good for listening songs because the audio quality is really amazing in this price. But the mic collects all the background noise and it cannot be used as an earphone. You van listen music though. Will not recommend if you are looking for a Bluetooth Earphone.
2998,4.0,"In very warm weather like 35°C, the earhooks expand, causing it to fall off, that's how I lost them. In winters it might become hard enough to hurt your ears(gues so).
Rather than that the headphone is of decent quality. Probably the cheapest Bluetooth headphone available today."
2999,5.0,"Its excellent. But at the time of delivery I was not in my house and the delivery boy dropped my pack at my door, without informing me anything. It is not an acceptable way to deliver a product. Anyone can take the product form there.
Sorry for late review."
3000,5.0,Everything is good about it. No issues at all. But you can feel that the material is of low grade but it's not. Try this buy this without any doubt.
3001,2.0,"The headphone was the great purchase. They give good sound, they confirm connection and low battery. They charge fast. And totally free my hands. One thing I noticed they interfere with my wifi router frequency somehow breaking up internet connection. Update after 4 months of use. One ear stopped working."
3002,2.0,Bought this product in oct 2019. Liked the performace and it was way too comfortable in usage. but from last week it stopped working. need replacement. Please help with warranty.. Tried calling cx centre .. but the call never gets connected; disappointed with the service
3003,4.0,"Review after one month
Bass is not up to mark as compared to wired headsets.
At this price range, it is good
Approx 7 hours charge. Got it for 999/- during a sale.
Easy to carry. Google assistant is awesome with this."
3004,4.0,"Great sound, great battery backup but zero noise cancellation. Very useful during calls mic is so clear, the other person does not know that am on an earphone. If noise cancellation was there it would have been the best Bluetooth headphones. No doubt in that."
3005,4.0,"Overall nice product for the price. Not the best out there but for someone looking for a Bluetooth headset within budget, it's a really good deal. Battery lasts as well. But would personally recommend keeping another wired earphones for regular use or backup."
3006,5.0,"Although sound is average and is nowhere close to Sony, still noise cancellation and Bluetooth connectivity is good"
3007,3.0,It's having battery life of 6 hours. The drawback is battery is not indicated properly. After 60 percent it will suddenly drop to 20 percent and the battery will die in 5 minutes. It can't handle too much of sweat.
3008,1.0,"This product is waste of money, I bought it and after some months, it's one side was not working. So I claim warranty, they picked the product. But after 13 days, when I am trying to contact them, their customer representative is not picking phone and I am not getting update in site"
3009,5.0,Good for listening to music. Loud! Awesome headset for music lovers. Good bass and terrible. But call sucks.
3010,3.0,"The model is good, easy to handle, fits good but while using this product during a mobile call the person at d other end is receiving a lot of noise from my surroundings. Plzzzz work on it..."
3011,5.0,"AWESOME HEADSETS I HAVE EVER TRY GOOD BUILT QUILITY AND GREAT HD SURROUNDED SOUND WITH DEEP BASS. SOMETIMES IT FEELS LIKE IT IS VIBRATING WITH BASS AND IT IS SO AWESOME.
HAVE TO TRY ONCE"
3012,2.0,Ear coad is down side it problem while not using it hanging to stomach and bettery was 60% after 30 minutes gone 20 after 5 minutes gone to switch off. I am disappointed with this item.
3013,4.0,"Sounds quality is good no noise cancellation
It's heavy in ear you can't use it continuously
Most important its connectivity it proper work when my mobile in front packet
When I put my mobile in back packet it's not working properly connection break."
3014,5.0,Value for money good battery life ok bass adequate high volume comfortable in ear and amazing nice cancellation
3015,4.0,"I am using this product from February 2019, now it's been almost 10 months now right side earphone is not working, so replacing the product as we have 1 year of warranty. Overall it's nice one. I bought it for 1099. Go for it."
3016,5.0,I got 999... Connectivity is very fast...bass is very good.. in one word it's very good for this price range.. go for it without any hesitation
3017,3.0,"I purchased this earphones in oct 2019 and suddenly it's not working properly .I have the warranty card of 1 year so , I have been using boat for a long time and didn't expect this from brand like boat I really hope they give good services to their customers in future ."
3018,1.0,"All good but i Found there is problem with Bettery
It behave abnormal.. from 60 % to direct 20 %.
well i have already requested for replacement.
After Replacement also i got defective product.
Worst Seller.. Better to go with other seller or Websites."
3019,1.0,Worst product.....waste of money....connection is not strong.....sound quality is so poor...too long wires...Amazon is not even returning this ...product....flipkart ...is much better in these cases....for returning....of the product ...you will feel headache if you will use it for tooo long ...
3020,1.0,"Worst product i have ever seen in my life, battery backup is worst. Not recommended to any one even its free offered.

Guys don't buy any products of Boat."
3021,4.0,"if you are radio listener lover( like me...lol) then this earphone might be the wrong choice for you, coz i had to download radio app which was really annoying and no local radio station i could play! so its just for regular music listener , with good bass n clear audio. but no radio so its worthless."
3022,5.0,"Good buy, but at times surrounding voice disturbs the person at the other end. In between sometimes the voice fades because of the displacement of the Mike from its original position."
3023,2.0,The bass and the sound quality are average but the build quality is sub par and will only last for about a year
3024,2.0,"The Bluetooth is good in other aspects however the noise cancellation doesn't support the device
Even the smallest of the sound can be heard by listener which is a disturbance in the communication.
Boat rockers you really have to work on this area."
3025,5.0,"i got this product during the sale and i did receive it with no damage.. product is awesome both by looks and function..would recommend every one to go for it worth of the price and quality ...
5 star for overall being happy with the product ..cheers :)"
3026,1.0,Left side of the headphones volume coming is very less. Not giving a complete bass experience. The product is not recommended as Bluetooth support is low the phone needs to be in nearest range itself. I picked up from amazon coz I didnt expected a duplicate product like wht I hv gt.
3027,5.0,"Sound quality average but best at this price
Connectivity a bit disappointing
Noise cancellation is not that good
Overall at this price range best product"
3028,3.0,"While in 40% battery showing with in 10 min, 0% and shutting it down, apprx for 4 to 5hrs only battery standing even using low volume"
3029,3.0,It's ok if you want a headphone for daily usage. However with 400-500 more you can experience a much better quality. I felt the sound was a little dampened.
3030,4.0,Has been using this headphones for over 6 months Bluetooth connectivity is awesome sound quality is ok ok but noise cancellation sucks and bass is something that is not in this earphones built quality good battery back-up is about 7 hours and full charging takes around 2 to 3 hours
3031,4.0,Bluetooth headset boat rockerz was pretty much good after I got back to one week usage of the product because Amazon as orginal certified quality for all time but price was too high than other online shopping.... thanks gave orginal product under that Flipkart was worst quality....
3032,2.0,The earphone was not good the left earpiece sound more then the right once and the logo on earpiece started erased after 3 days and the sound is very low actually i can hear my sorrouding voices on full volume i was a boat fan i used many earphone of boats but this one was not good
3033,4.0,"Today only i have revived the product. If i say about the product , It's really value for money. Good Base, Call Quality and device pairing is too good. If any one is looking for Bluetooth headset with budget then go for this product.

Thank to Amazon for quick delivery and thanks to Boat for quality product."
3034,5.0,"Superb Bluetooth earphone at this price..
It fits well in to 👂, good bass and voice.. battery life is also good.. easy to carry also.. one negative point is that it will protruding little bit outside(it's wire) while listening..."
3035,1.0,After a month the headset wouldnt turn on. Power issue. Waiting for replacement product to aarive. Never expected the product to be faulty at such a short time. My gym workouts have got boring. Had to buy a 450inr Samsung earphones to make due for the temporary inconvenience.
3036,5.0,"Amazing product. I am using this product from 9 months, yet didn't face any problem. The product is of very good quality. Sound quality is very good. Battery backup us superb. Once charge, it goes whole day long with random calls and listening music. Ideal for workout. SATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT!"
3037,2.0,"Its not comfortable to ear ... ear pain....
Abnormal sound Occured more than 10 times in 3 days During incoming / outgoing calls too much disturbances or abnormal sound from earphone..."
3038,5.0,I loved it!! they block all noise. They are flexible. easy to connect. cheap. Altough their earbuds do get loose sometimes but its a minor problem. i got what i was looking for.
3039,5.0,"The sound quality is superb specially if you like more bass, the noise cancellation is also awesome, and it's very comfortable using it for long hours coz it doesn't hurt your ears.

But one suggestion is the battery life, if you can extend the battery life."
3040,1.0,"Don't buy this. After the return period is over, voice trembling started. Range also less only"
3041,5.0,Sound is awesome... Bass if fully loaded ... Design is superb ...

3044,4.0,"Works well when phone is in your hand/ pocket.
If phone is away or in another room voice gets disconnected."
3045,5.0,"A very good option is such a price range, and overall experience is phenomenal.

Bluetooth connectivity is average and battery backup could be made a lot better."
3046,2.0,"It's been almost a month now that I started using boat rockerss. I am facing so many issues
1. The connection is not continuous it's gets disconnected on its own even though my mobile Bluetooth is turned on.
2. The sound quality is not that great."
3047,4.0,"In a room it is ok. But as soon as I go out from the room then connectivity is a problem. Even if call comes, if mobile is not in my hand then couldn't connect to the incoming call. Otherwise sound quality, Bluetooth connectivity in close proximity is good."

Edit:
Charging point of this earphone is not working anymore...after use of 5 months."

3052,5.0,"I'm already a customer of Boat. I had used boat 225 twice. I had referred to my friends to buy Boat for more than five members. For fitness purpose Im not suitable with boat 225. So with out any confusion I bought Boat 255 Bluetooth. Very useful,effective worthy product."
3053,4.0,"Was really happy about the product sound , unfortunately within 7 months my headsets left earpiece stopped working, now searching how to claim for warranty ; and god knows whether when i will be getting and how much time it will take."

3056,4.0,"When switching between audio calls to video calls, the headphone gets disconnected from the phone and unable to reconnect , have to disconnect the call and make call again for using headphone. Battery life not long."

3060,4.0,"Really nice and satisfying, the only problem I found was when doing hard cardio workout the earphones come off, else the product is worth it."

Some time the mic also doesn't works."
3067,5.0,"Awesome.....Best quality
But the Mike sensitivity is high....While using headphones for calling catches background sound which creates noise in call"
3068,4.0,"Do like the battery backup and the sound quality, for the price you pay you get a lot of earphone here. The design is quite good and you wouldn't notice it when wearing a t shirt. You do notice it while wearing a collared shirt but it's negligible at best."
3069,1.0,"This headphone is not having good sound quality.
If you not believe it then play any song and listen it in simple headphones of samsung and sony and compare it with this boat 255 rocker bluetooth headphones you will get the result"
3070,3.0,"Product is very good no doubt. But after 3/4 months, one the speaker is not working & I am facing inconvenience in listing the music. I have aleady writeen a mail to the actual seller for replacement. You are also requested to look into the same on priority. Thanks & regards,"
3071,3.0,The dissapointing problem with this is you can not really talk wearing this. The other person on call always complains about the disturbances nd noise during call. I have to discomnect this nd talk with phone speaker directly when ever i recieve a call. Thats really dissapointing
3072,4.0,There is nothing to dislike in boat rockerzz but if I have to say the battery capacity should be increased other than that the sound quality is perfect and the bass nothing to say its amazing the bass is boat rockerzz is better than realme buds wireless... Which had 12nm driver..
3073,2.0,"Product is very good but, its one side sound not working after 1 month when i tey to register complend its essy to register. After 2 weeks no call back from boat sapport to me . Very bed service ."

Guys it is value for money. Its amazing and very nice product .
3076,4.0,Trust me!!! I have purchased recently. It's not that good what you expect. But if you have low budget for bluetooth earphone. You can purchase this. This is an option not a must try
3077,5.0,"Sound clarity and bass are balanced up to 70% volume after that bass overpowering sound clarity. but believe me, 60-70% volume is more than enough.

bass is overpowering vocals on high volume. Otherwise, it's great earphone at this price."
3078,1.0,"Bluetooth speaker is not working only left side is working this is 1 year warrenty so I was purchased around 17 October now this is March month so this is in warranty so please change this bluetooth as soon as possible , I will purchase 2 bluetooth so please return this bluetooth"
3079,1.0,"Overall the product is a waste of money.
The sound quality is very bad, you may find review of good sound quality but trust me the product in this range is waste of money.
Thish may be good for the workout, running but what's the use if the sound quality is not even close to the mark."
3080,5.0,Battery life can be improved..This is for bass lovers as I am not able to find in any other Bluetooth earphones at this price
3081,1.0,"Uncomfortable, impossible to wear when riding!, low volume, clarity and bass not at all good.."
3082,4.0,Great sound quality and noise cancellation(but sometimes this is a negative aspect as you cannot hear anything outside). But these kind of earphones can become a bit uncomfortable for ears to be used for long periods of time (because they go in too deep in your ears.
3083,1.0,"As my headphones are not working, I'm trying to register a complaint on Boat support site. But it gives me above error as showing in attached screenshot while registering complaint.
Boat Support Team can you please help me to replace my non-working headphones."
3084,3.0,How can i claim warrenty for these bluetooth earphones...because one side of the earphone are not working
3085,4.0,Reallyyy Awesome product. Sound clarity and charging everything is really worth of money. At first I faced some issues while pairing with my Redmi phone. After that everything is superbbbbb. Battery of the life is nearly 8hrs to 10hrs in a day.
3086,5.0,Sound is good but if you hate bass than this is not right ... It has extremely high bass .. noise cancellation is perfect... And the quality is absolutely premium.
3087,5.0,Excellent product..awesome sound quality.. decent look.. easy to carry.. connects faster to any mobile.. Best choice
3088,5.0,Excellent product and quality. But only drawback is that the distance covered is only 3 feet...that's quite disappointing !!!
3089,3.0,OK But blue tooth range is very less it should not have any obstacles to work like wooden partition or wall
3090,1.0,"Please don't buy this Boat Rockerz 255
Noise cancellation system is not in this product
Worst product
Compair to this product with Artis 910 Bluetooth wireless earphone is one of the finest quality product
In Artis 910 noise cancellation system is superbbbbbb"
3091,4.0,"This device is very good but some time there is problem with connectivity other wise sound quality and bettary backup is so good in this price...
And at one time connected with two device this feture is so good and very helpfull for thoes people who carry two mobile phones."
3092,3.0,"This Bluetooth earphone overall a good quality earphone. Only problem is it's earbuds which quality is not satisfactory.
The sound quality competes with the sound quality that is Skullcandy. For a moderate user, it will last for more or less 6 hours."
3093,4.0,Good product with a decent sound quality average bass don't expect too much in this price range as it feels great in your daily use as a Bluetooth device and connect well with my OnePlus 7
3094,1.0,Dont how does it works with other phones but with honour pro i used to get headache whenever i use it...
3095,4.0,"Sound quality is good but the volume compared to the boat rockerz450 is way better.. Since its a in -ear headphone boad could have worked on it a little more.. The bass and great.. There is no screachy sound while listening to music, video or any vocal sound..
Battery is good..
Good quality product."
3096,1.0,This is a complete waste product. just after two days it stopped working. I can't even hear the other persons voice during voice calls. I even replaced the item again but same story.overall very disappointed with the product.
3097,4.0,The sound is great... connectivity is good... use just for one day... troubles when u run... the hard band jumps off... for running I wud say use without any hard band..
3098,3.0,"Sound quality is average
Bass is more than enough
Perfectly suitable for outdoor activities
Very poor battery life
Very poor microphone"
3099,5.0,"The product is definitely best in class. Although it mentions that the headset is multipoint enabled, it could not connect to my two iPhones at the same time. Returned."
3100,3.0,"I will say it ia a good product. Not very good as said in the description.
For Music it is good and for calls it takes 1 to 2 seconds to receive a call. But overall worth to by if u can get under 1000 rupees."
3101,3.0,The sound is just awesome. Product finishing and the quality of material is not so good.. connectivity is also good.. overall the product is buyable.
3102,2.0,The build quality of the product was good. It was comfortable to wear. But the audio quality was one very worse. The audio quality was like a 100 RS street headphones. It was one of the headphones with worst quality of audio.
3103,1.0,"It gets into sleep mode very frequently,also switching between 2devices is tedious.

Product is not user friendly.

I discarded this product"
3104,3.0,All is okay in this earphone just one problem is their zero noise cancellation... Even i can count it to have -ve point out of 10 for noise cancellation........ Please do something for this problem... Otherwise sound quality and everything is superb worth of cost...
3105,1.0,The worst earpiece I have ever come across.. you'll have to go beyond 70% volume level (which is termed as something that can damage you ears) in order to listen any video or songs.. bass is poor as it can be. Seemed like I bought a 50rs worth earpiece from roadside
3106,3.0,"Whenever I speak on a call, the background noise is heard loudly than my own voice to the opposite person speaking on call with me.
After 5 months of usage, the left side speaker stopped working and after 7 months of usage both the speakers are stopped working."
3107,5.0,"I don't know much about earphones but this is the best headset I've ever purchased. Though this is a first impression but I'm sure it'll last. Two of my cousins already have this and we're happy. Sound quality is awesome, it's crisp and clear."
3108,1.0,"There’s no option to provide negative rating, else would have given that.
Battery gets drained within 15/20 mins and device gets hit with minimal usage. Thought of initiating return, unfortunately return window gets closed in 10 days. Would not recommend this to anyone !!!"

There may be some issue with Bluetooth connectivity but most of the time it's cool."
3133,4.0,Best option for the first time users of a Bluetooth earphones. Best product for the price range. Sound quality is good for the price range. Just that the wire for the earphone is too long than required though it has magnet on the earbuds... it dangles.

3138,5.0,"First impressions : Great
After a few days of usage, still feels good. Only one thing how does a battery % of 60 makes it go discharged. Either it shows wrong % of battery indicator or something is wrong with mine Boat.

Anyways, I am still delighted to have it."

Thank you."
3146,4.0,Decent earpieces in this range. Do keep slipping out of the ear though. Sound quality is fine and Bluetooth connectivity is also nice. Could improve the color/appearence a bit to give it a premium feel.
3147,5.0,"Awesome purchase.. good look and quality..
But Boat customer service is very very worst. As long as your earphones works , thats fine. If any problem, no response from boat and they will not replace your product. So think and go for it"
3148,1.0,Sound quality and noise cancellation ok. Battery is pathetic. Drains within an hour of use. Indicator suddenly drops from 90% to 5% in few minutes and then it shuts down. Not used even for a week. What a waste!!
3149,5.0,"The best sound quality, noise cancellation, easily connects to bluetooth and the welcome not when switched on 'welcome to nirvana' that justifies the noise cancellation feature.."
3150,1.0,"Defective product received and box too seems to be tampered .
I had ordered a black headset but I recd a red coloured one which wud be fine if the product was new and good. But it's an old damaged piece and the main box of the product seemed to be tried to tampered with."
3151,2.0,"build quality, comfort and connectivity is good.. calling is ok.. but sound quality is just disappointing in this price.. feels like 200 rs headphone.. can't play game with this. u ll be confused from which side enemy is coming or shooting.."
3152,1.0,"Waste of money. This product just got disconnected from my phone many times then many times it switched off automatically. Product not up to the mark as described by the seller.
Boat do fix this issue on your headphone boat rockerz 255."
3153,4.0,"I bought it for my wife and she is very happy to have it. I purchased @999 during Amazon prime day sale. The sound quality is great, the battery back-up is also great. Durable n light weighted.

3155,1.0,I purchase boAt Rockerz 255 few months ago and one side is not working now. I tried raising a complain but instead they gave me addresses of service center which are atleast 19 kms away from my place. Don't buy Boat products coz their service is worst.

I have used these earphones for about 1.5 years, still didn't face any issue also recommend to my friends and ordered around 7 to 8 from my account itself."
3162,4.0,First of all the design is good and premium. Sound quality is superb including extra bass while watching videos on YouTube. And noise cancelling is better for this price.
3163,3.0,"Battery life is very poor, purpose of wireless is defeated when you have to charge it more than once a day."
3164,3.0,"Over hyped, battery dies from 60% to 0 faster than you count the numbers. If you get this within 800 RS after all discount then only go for it"
3165,1.0,I didnt like the product. Noise cancellation is zero. The person couldnt hear my voice rather he/ she is able to hear the voices in my background. And its been a month product start losing its colour. I wish i could return it back.. if you can take it back please take it

3170,4.0,"Right earphone not working, got it replaced, now fine but little micro lag while gaming"
3171,5.0,"For basic level, these headset is best to have. Its just its mic does not pick the sound in proper way. While travelling in train, bus or on bike.. your sound would be heard less to the other party through this headset. Rest sound quality is good."
3172,5.0,Sound quality is great.sound clearity cristal clear. Bluetooth range is unbelievable. It works even room is closed.
3173,1.0,Headphones are good. But It stops working on one side after 5-6 months. The BoAt Replacement service is very pathetic . They never reply on time to the mail. Never updates the tickets on time. I have received a replacement but they are not working either. Its just a pathetic service.

3177,4.0,"All the surrounding sounds getting disturbing for the caller who listen our voice, unable to catch the bluetooth distance more than a meter"
3178,1.0,The sound quality and noise cancellation is good but the product is not durable at all. I have it for around three months and have replaced it twice.

3183,4.0,Sound quality very good. Battery life could be better to make it perfect. Also the length of wire could be reduced/adjustable. Currently too long
3184,3.0,"Ok.. in that price... Not much battery backup .
For me feels like the ear things not fit so fine.. I have to get used to of it.. it's not quite comfortable."
3185,5.0,"I got this for 1k and at this price i can say this is best, even better than other 3k 4k earphones.

3188,5.0,Sound quality is flawless...you can experience the boom!!! Connection is quite fast...only problem is battery. It dies very soon and I have to charge twice a day for minimum an hour to make it 100% Beside this 1 lag it is worth to buy and it is value for money.
3189,2.0,Product is an average product nothing to special about it. One draw back which really put me off was while walking or travelling the phone was in my pocket and i was listening to songs on the headphones it has regular breakage in sound and distortion also. Sadly
3190,5.0,"I like everything in this bluetooth device . I wish everyone who is looking for a wireless earphones should go through it . Trust me it is a great product with a great battery backup , better sound than samsung level ! And smarter than any other in this range ."

3193,1.0,"Headphone performance was good but they went dead within 3months of useage..

And audio quality is cranky"
3200,5.0,After a use of a month I'm reviewing it.. Sound quality n noise cancellation are good and even it fits comfortably in the ears.. only thing for me annoying is the battery life is not that much good. It comes around 3-4 hours barely in full charge ...

3247,4.0,"The battery life is amazing and works for a day with average use.
The bass felt a little off but once you get used to it you don't realise any difference.
The sound quality is decent for the price.
The build and the magnets are also very good."
3248,5.0,Good product with very good sound quality. Only one problem gets disconnected any time after continuous use for half an hour. Sound also misses frequently for less than a second time
3249,4.0,"Good sound.. only bad quality is, its made on low quality plastic neck band. Bt sound quality and ear plug quality is super..."
3250,3.0,Some what sound quality noise cancellation also nominal but i didn't expect these kind of stuff from boat like companies
3251,5.0,Sound quality is just amazing. Noise cancellation also working properly. Bluetooth connectivity is also good.
3252,3.0,"""Charging capacity"" is only 2hours in a day. I checked for 1week now I need replacement of new one"
3253,4.0,I am happy to review sound quality is very nice but one problem is that you can't hear sound more than 20 minutes because of air bud quality it so bad
3254,2.0,"boat should do something for claimimg warranty
its just 6 months and my earphone boat rockers 255 one side just stopped working
i had bought 2 and both were the same
now i want to claim my warranty and it says wrong bill no inspite of putting the right one"
3255,4.0,Noise cancellation is the biggest problem in it. If you spend this money on a earphone then you will get great experience. After 40% battery it's hardy stand 1 minute only. I think Don't go for it if you are spending 1200 - 1400 Go for earphone ( No charging)
3256,5.0,I took it for 1000rs on prime day the bass is asome and range may be 20mts and it is comfortable fixes in ears the sound quality is good and best product at less price I have JBL wire earphones but this is asome then that thank you Amazon for a great product.
3257,1.0,"Sound Quality good
But Automatic Distribution issue
And charging indicators not working led"
3258,4.0,Sound quality is good.... Bass is good..... U can take shower wearing this and can enjoy music also at the same time....if u r looking for waterproof and good quality earphone..... Go for it... Without any hesitation
3259,1.0,It just stopped charging. The blue light is on when I put for charging but don’t charge. Never expected this from Amazon’s choice product. I either need a replacement or some other normal headphones. Utterly disappointed guys.
3260,3.0,"It is good headphone if brought under 1k. Sound quality is good for its price. Build is sturdy.
Only problem I faced was the in ear part of headphone. It did not fit properly, hence after 1.5 hrs it starts paining for me."
3261,1.0,Using this earphone for approx an year now and its just pathetic in terms of calls and noise cancellation. It enhances noise instead of cancelling it. Person on the other side can only hear everything nearby except your voice.
3262,4.0,This earphone are really god. Bass is to punchy. Treible is decent. You can ajdust with your phone equialzer. Build quality is superb. The should provide case with it.
3263,5.0,"Awesome sound quality
Good battery backup
Very nice noice cancellation

Using from past 6 months, really happy !!!"
3264,5.0,Very good product at this price. Works as expected with no issues from the last 1 month
3265,1.0,The thin wire couldn't handle the weight of the earbuds. Got loose from the connected neck supporter. I was not satisfied. Total Waste of Money. Very expensive for a bad make of the product. Poor research and development of the product.
3266,5.0,"Good earphone at this price . Excellent connectivity , noise cancellation & battery life . Works very well with both Laptop & mobile . Just go for it ."
3267,4.0,Using This Product 2 months ago product is working fine but the battery of this after 4-5 hours automatically low
3268,2.0,It's totally worst product for those who wants to use this product for calling purpose.
3269,3.0,"Sometimes facing difficulty connecting to Bluetooth.
Build quality is very cheap, didn't look great when you wear.
Sound quality is good."
3270,4.0,"So I like everything about this bluetooth. It's battery life, sound, range of connectivity. But when I talk to people on call they could hear the voice of my surrounding clearly but couldn't hear my voice. So basically even if it says notice cancellation but it doesn't work."
3271,4.0,"Good headphone. But battery life is not sufficient. And the wire is long and kind of disturbing in ur ears. Sound quality is good but not premium. Still it can be improved. Build quality is nice.
Lastly, i returned it bcz of the lengthy wire and insufficient battery backup."
3272,1.0,"Returned the product within 5 days.
Pathetic performance when making a phone call. The other party hears the whole surrounding voice except yours.

Very much disappointed with Boat this time."
3273,5.0,Till now it is working very fine.Good sound quality and noise cancellation. I would recommend this earphone for people who like high bass.
3274,1.0,"After 6 days it's only one side is hearing other side is not working , I bought from Bangalore for my friend and sent to his place Tamilnadu. Now return policy is 10 days tomorrow is last date don't know what to do. Totally disappointed"
3275,4.0,"As per bass goes this is the best there is but battery does not last as per the info provided , connectivity is fast and easy but is good for about 3 mts , and sound quality drops while playing one the move .
Budget wise good and valued for the money."
3276,1.0,The battery backup of the earphone is very poor.The battery suddenly drops down from 60% to 40% or 20% immediately and so the entire meaning of using wireless is needless when the battery which was supposed to work for 6 hours is not working for even 3 hours
3277,3.0,I was purchase today that item but bluetooth connectivity it's too low range i just walk up next passages and that connectivity so poor. And if you ear is small so is not perfect fit your ear. but songs quality is very good! Bass is very loud.That my review.
3278,3.0,"Quality is good. But, the battery percentage is shown properly. It only shows 100,80,60, 40 and 20. Worse part is, once it reaches 60%, it drains completely within 10 -15 mins. It's too bad for regular usage. Kindly improve this in upcoming products. Thanks."
3279,5.0,"All are good in this product, like noise cancellation, bluetooth connectivity, sound quality & main thing look. Don't think to much, go & grab asap."
3280,5.0,"This is an amazing product. Delivered by Amazon within 12 hours with ""Morning delivery."" A small safety concern that whenever you are using the earphones, the surrounding sound is not audible at all, even if the volume is low. So use it carefully, stay safe and enjoy the product."
3281,4.0,"It's quite good... After research for bluetooth earphone I bought this product from Amazon. Price is perfect. If someone searching for good Bluetooth earphones, go for it, it will better for you.. It's amazingly good... Sound quality very good... Bluetooth connectivity quite good..."
3282,4.0,Good product but too much of advertisement disturbs our mood and continues use may cause sudden disconnect from the device
3283,3.0,"I did purchased from 999 sale but m not satisfy to the quality and performance, its getting trouble in battery life because it showing 20% and after 1 hour showing 40% without any charging, and call quality also not good and noise cancellation feature not working at all"
3284,5.0,"It's just not the name Boat Roackerz, they do Rock it.
Amazing sound quality with clear vocals and perfect bass effect.
No problem with receiving calls or for the person to hear on the other side, clear voice transmission.
Go for it without a hiccup."
3285,3.0,"The earphone is good, have good sound quality, have good noice cancellation and nice bass.
But exactly after 6 months of purchase one side is not working. As it was during warranty period I have given it for replacement."
3286,1.0,"This is pathetic product, don't buy it. You will not able to talk properly with this headset. There is so much noise when we talk on call. I bought 3 headset but not getting any resolution from Amazon as well as boat company."
3287,4.0,Getting disconnected when I am in traffic but if I am in one place no issues with connectivity otherwise so far so good no problem
3288,5.0,"Really good sound and bass. Comfy even for longer usage. Only small issue is, sound gets blurry at 40 feet and further from your source."
3289,4.0,Its a Good product with very good sound quality. Yes but when driving there are some disturbance in connectivity with Mobile.
3290,5.0,Sound quality is excellent. Bass is good. I bought this mainly for using while working out. Its sweat proof as well. Worth Buying
3291,4.0,"If u are looking for decent thing under 2k go for them, but there is nill noise cancelation. Sometimes the noise is more than the person talking."
3292,1.0,"In a matter of 4 months after order this 1300 something product stopped taking charge and i have no idea how. Very be blutooth connectivity keeps giving the buffers you don't expect , sound quality is okkish.,! Overall Dont waste your money here."
3293,1.0,"The sound is pathetic. Very good bass and loudness. But lacks clarity . Buy only if under 800₹ . NOT WORTH ABOVE IT.
It is ideal for people who are just buying for bollywood music. Not recommended for people who listen to music with details."
3294,4.0,"I bought it in 899 only. In 899 you will get this kind of product which is really great. The bass is really high,you can't hear all the instrument because of this. Otherwise it is a great wireless headset.. Boat is really good in mid range market love it😍🤗"
3295,3.0,Its a flat feeling ..not suitable for actually music lovers who knows every detail of music ...i cant find beat ..also wire is very long which does not have anything to hand
3296,4.0,"Sound quality is decent but bass sounds quality is so higher, otherwise great value of money product. Ear bids size is little bit big...not so comfortable for full day use..."
3297,5.0,Excellent products in idle position. Distortion while jogging. Overall good product for price
3298,4.0,"Good-
1. Sound.
2. Bass.
3. Noise Cancellation.
4. Packaging and delivery.
You can use for 3-4 days on a single charge. Just one issue i think is as soon as battery goes down to 60% it gives indication to charge."
3299,3.0,Its design is not good.. loose and extra long wires irritates me...bluetooth connectivity is not good...sound quality is good average....better to take boult earphone of the same price whose design and quality of bluetooth connectivity both r good
3300,2.0,"Pros : It's performance is up to mark. Very satisfactory.
Cons : The design is not ear friendly. The ear grip provided causes pain in ear. After few minutes it starts itching badly in ears. You can't plug-in for long which is the sole purpose of buying headphones."
3301,4.0,The sound quality and noise cancelation is good and Bluetooth connectivity is awsone

3304,4.0,"bass quality & sound is just poor, can't even be compared to boat rockerz 600 or 400 headphones ( they are outstanding) anyways its good for taking calls and doing day to day stuff. i would suggest to go for Sony's wired headphones or try jbl one's."
3305,2.0,Lasted only for 6 months.... Battery drains fast and has stopped working now. I've to charge everyday and after sometime it goes dead. Not satisfied with this one.
3306,1.0,"It is one of the worst headphones. The day I got the product, one of the earbud was not working. And the Amazon app is not giving the option to return the product. When I went to the Boat store, the staff was not at all helpful, they told me they won't take the product as they don't repair Bluetooth earphones."
3307,1.0,"This Product is Dope According to it's price range factor, with pretty Sound Quality but 2months after the initial use The Right Earpiece Stopped to work With Doing any physical damage to the Earplugs. This Problem has Been Faced By many people after some time purchasing this product"
3308,3.0,"Pros: 1) It takes just an hour for complete charging
2) good bass and noise cancellation
3) stays put on the ears

Cons: 1) it works good for first 6 months, then it depends on your luck
2) it's not worth for the price for 6 month working product"

3312,1.0,"One of the worst earphones you can buy at this price. Sound quality is extremely poor and Noise cancellation is also terrible. Bass is extremely poor.

Also the only good point about this earphone is dual connectivity."
3313,1.0,"My Bluetooth device is not properly working there is some connectivity issues first the device is normally connet to my phone than after some time this was disconnected suddenly without any reason

Plz fix it otherwise gime me anyone some tips for how to fix this problem"

3315,5.0,Sound wise it's better. But connectivity get interpreted if your just few meters away from it. Full Battery stands for 3 hours straight.
3316,1.0,"Review after 6 months use.
I faced usual problem about connectivity. During call, background noice is mlre than me.
And now before six months left nod of earphone got broken.
Sound quality is good at this price range."
3317,5.0,"Overall its a very nyc product with awesome sound quality and noise cancellation is upto the mark as promised by boat.
The only problem which I find is that the battery gets drained easily..
Bt on top off its a good product."
3318,4.0,It says it can connect 2 devices simultaneously but I Doesn't ! The item is too sensitive .. rest of the specification are good . But being boAt rockerzz 255 its not quiet up to it boAt rockerzz 220 gives better performance then this.
3319,1.0,"Sending second hand product, be cautious you may get ear infection with used products."
3320,3.0,"Product decent but the quality is very cheap but packaging was very bad, I received open packet of the Bluetooth headset."
3321,2.0,It works only when it is charging mode and when after 2 hours we remove the charger it stop working as power is off automatically and even after several attempts it is unable to on. It seems like a faulty headset.
3322,5.0,Good to use and comfortable product. Just noise cancelation is wort very bad. Battry backup sufficient for whole day in one hour charging.
3323,4.0,"Writing this review after used 3 months. Sound quality with bass is good. I use it 3 to 5 times a day 10 to 20 mints on average on each time. Though the battery backup comes for 2 days.

But there would be a signal problem when the distance crossed b/w mobile and headphones."
3324,5.0,"Overall performance is best but bass sound is quit lower than wired headstones or boat rockerz 400

If you are going for enjoying DJ bass and hd sound then go for boat rockerz 400.."

My only issue would be the part around the neck. Gets uncomfortable and irritating in humid climates."
3328,5.0,Blue tooth connection is not fast. Battery is excellent. Worth the price for less than 1k in offer. Mic quality is good. Its weight is very less and dont feel it when you wear it.

3330,5.0,"Very good sound quality, value for money, good base, noise cancellation is also good, built quality is also good"

3333,5.0,"Sound quality far better in this price range (I bought it for Rs 999, during great India. Sale ). Very convenient to use and lay easily on neck. Battery life is not yet evaluate d precisely, but still it is not down after 5 + hours. I just got it today and charged for an hour even it was charged."
3334,3.0,I got the product replaced as the first one was not working properly. But even the replaced product has come with opened seal. So I'll test it for few days and then decide whether I'll be using it or not. I've also logged my feedback to Amazon.
3335,5.0,Occasional bluetooth connectivity loss in a crowded train in Mumbai. Battery shows visual indication of 20% charge but is lower so device informs low battery and switches off. Overall totally worth a purchase. Great product for the price point.
3336,5.0,Only one problem is there when someone called me they can hear clear noise of my surroundings.they complain about that nd insist to talk without earphone so it's a very very very big issue with this earphone.. Otherwise it's ok.. You can buy it
3337,2.0,"Sound breaks at times, seems issue with loose bluetooth connection or quality of this earphone.

Baas effect is poor. Most of times it outpowers voice inside music and you cannot hear words. Boat needs to work a lot on this."

3389,5.0,This is the product iam looking for jogging purpose..finally i feel like the bass king sound it genarated..iam loving the product and using it in gym also..very great headphone..it is lightweight and sweatproof.
3390,4.0,"Pesa wasool product... Good Quality with flexible neck band...
After 2 month one side ear phone is not working.. And I Went to the service center and in 5 minutes, they got a new Boat 255 ear phone. I was shockt it's a very good service.. Buy it"
3391,4.0,i buy 3 pcs its good but personally i didn't like though but if you have to travel alot you have to go for it battery life is gud but i am comfortable with the ear ports but my friend used it and they had a good experience with it.
3392,1.0,"Not a durable product. After 5 months of use one of its ear piece deteriorated and sound became extremely low, it almost died. Not expected from this brand!"
3393,1.0,"During calls, both during incoming and outgoing calls the other / receiver end was unable to hear anything from my end. So returned the product to the company. Highly disappointed from this particular products' performance within six weeks of purchase ."
3394,2.0,I brought this product before 3 months back. Now it got damaged. I had have lost the box. How can get my warrant back. I was trying to put it in the BOAT official page but it is asking for invoice number. Where will I get invoice number without the box.
3395,3.0,It is good though it is having a battery backup issue that as soon as it reach to 40% capacity than within next 5-10 mins it gets drained fully. I was surprised so checked with my brother who had also bought the same and he had also faced the same issue
3396,3.0,"Poor service centre facility,
One earplug was not working, I send it to service centre
They stopped picking up calls, it came back after a month
Very dissatisfied with boat
Dissorting sound at back
I will surely not recommend it"
3397,4.0,"Good product.
But as mentioned in the box, all the accessories were missing. Other than the earphone there was no Manual, extra pair of earbuds, usb cable and the warranty card. Really disappointed with Amazon delivery. This shouldn't be happening."
3398,3.0,Decent product for the price. Battery runs out pretty quick not for full day use.
3399,4.0,"I have 3 items of boat
2 Bluetooth headset
And one headphone
These all stop working and the defect is right side speaker is not working at all I am gonna return these 3 boat headset and never gonna buy it again I have told everyone to buy it bcoz of my good experience but boat broke my trust now"
3400,4.0,Performance wise its fine.. comfort is there but i cant wear it for so long because my ears start paining. Look wise I won't say its damn stylish as it look like in the picture.
3401,2.0,First one i order had connectivity issues so i order a replacement...look at the pictures of replacement product... package looks tampered or used..and the earphones were dirty also
3402,2.0,All is well but the main feature bluetooth connectivity is not working properly. It works within only 2 feet distance.
3403,4.0,"When using my headset when calling, all of them tell me they are unable to hear my voice clearly as there is some kind of disturbance."
3404,5.0,Some ppl may think the bass is high but my overall experience with the product is more than i expected. Battery life and the durability is also very much impressive. Similar to Samsung level U but best than that the flexible band is very comfortable. my score 5/5
3405,5.0,"Basically I am music lover. Upto my knowledge it's an extra ordinary product. Sound is good. Bass is superb. 90 min to take full charge.
7 hrs to discharge if we use continuously.
Now I am a fan of boat and Amazon. Go for it. No need to think"
3406,2.0,"Hello.. this is Rakesh
I purchased boat rockerz255
In august... its was worked good till nov 10
Suddenly left ear in working only one right ear is working... it has one year manufacturing warranty pls help me to find out coustmer care service center.."
3407,4.0,"I ve been a constant fan of Boat products and LL their products have been top quality. The battery backup is really good and the sound, no disappointment with that. A big fan of their bass tech. Overall loved it."
3408,1.0,This product is not working properly. When using voice not hear properly.it's battery discharge with in few minutes of usage. I expected more from this product. But unfortunately now I couldn't use this product. Can you refund my money by return this product ?
3409,2.0,Use less. Noise cancelation very bad. Mice is also not good. Fit is also not good
3410,5.0,"The product is good, bass is nice , noise cancellation is there but not to that extent but for the price you pay that is quite decent (INR 999)
Battery life is also good, the only thing I would have expected is better packing atleast a small case should be provided"
3411,3.0,"This headset only lasted for 4 months after that the ear piece was not working, sobits definitely not for sports use"
3412,5.0,"One of the best product i have seen ever....
Awesome product Everyone must try
Best sound quality, best outlooks, and every thing is best i mean i just don't have words to explain this product....
Very very awesome product...."
3413,1.0,"Not satisfied..
After use of five months one side of headphones was automatically not working properly.. and when i was trying to contact amezon customer care they don't even answer the call. Very disappointed by amezon customer service"
3414,1.0,"I have bought this product on 2nd September. Its been only 2 month and One side of earphones is not working at all, when am trying to raise complain that also not worth. Fooling people by giving 1 year of warranty. Worst experience with Amazon as well boat rockerz"
3415,5.0,Battery life is not as long as expected. Lasts upto 6hrs. Sound quality is very good. Bass and noise cancellations are good. I got it for 899 and i think its a fair deal.
3416,4.0,if its on off for 999 for sure go for it worth the price and does its job pretty well.
3417,4.0,Writing after 10 days of usage. Highly disappointed because this captures surrounding noise very heavily and transfer it to the caller that they receive only 20% of our voice and 80% noise. If it's ok then you can buy it. Otherwise sound quality is good.
3418,4.0,I have been using this product since 6months and i faced not even a single issue but one day my one side of earphones stopped working i claimed the warranty and the boat support team was quite supportive. I must say go for it👍🏻
3419,4.0,Good Choice and reached on time recommended option if u accepted with small form wire setup
3420,5.0,Best earphone in 15k.. i got it in just rs 999.... Go for it. Its bass is awesome super punchy and deep base... Sound quality is preety awesome.. battery back up also awesome... Don't read fake review.Just go for it. Its awesome😍
3421,4.0,this product right here is one of the best bluetooth earpiece under the budget segment.loved the way its build nice and clean.the sound output from this thing will blow your ears and minds for sure.bought it from sale and fully satisfied at this price
3422,1.0,"Though there a icon showing warranty yet I don't get any options to contact Amazon or seller in anyway. Quality perished after 7 months of use.

Amazon choice product are just garbage."
3423,4.0,"Everything Is Well Expect
Mic is poor
Metrial Quality is Not Well
Else Good
Nice For Music , Not For Calling"
3424,5.0,"Kinda good product, but the package was not sealed as if it was second hand or opened and used and then packed again.
But ya the sound quality, bass is better than good...
On full volume it consumed 20% battery in 3.30 hrs"
3425,4.0,Good sound. Very clear and distinct. Noise cancellation is enough for low level noise. High decibel noise can hamper your music experience though. Good at this price. Working for last 3 months seamlessly
3426,1.0,while connected with the phone many times its goes to silent automatically. even sometimes didn't ring while phone need to be ring....also its panic think for ear.... worst product yaaaar
3427,2.0,"Overall good but not recommend for running and aerobic exercise the earbuds just slipped every time,even in gym also."
3428,5.0,"Sound quality....
This product is value for 💰.. nice sound quality.. deep pure bass, betterly balanced not overpowering but enough for a bass headed person.. mids are nice highs are clear and overall well built.. sturdy desingn....
I recommend it🤗"
3429,4.0,"What I like about this is its lightweight. Comfortable in ear. It's range working perfectly in 20 metres.
Now what I think is weak part of the product is sound quality although it is good but not upto the wired one from boat. Also battery life is above average."
3430,5.0,"Noise cancellation was excellent when compared to other products,simply worthy and nice to use by all people"
3431,5.0,"The sound quality is just great. Bass is also quite good. At this price, it is the best in the market"
3432,4.0,Good bass. Treble could be better. It stops external noise to a good extent. Satisfied for this price range.
3433,5.0,Noise cancellation is good while u r on with music it can cut u off from world on high volume...calls work fine too not great noise cancellation here...but good battery life and sound
3434,3.0,Not recommend for long time use. There will be lot of pain in the ear using it for more than a hour.
3435,5.0,Immersive sound quality and noise cancellation is top of the line. Bass is high and the treble is a bit low. Other than that everything is fine
3436,1.0,"The product was working good...until one day it decided to quit it's job of being a earphone. It just took 3 months for the earphones to stop working. Now the manufacturer (boAt)is not taking the complainant ahead, stating that invoice given by Amazon is invalid."
3437,1.0,No value for money. I have claimed warranty twice within 3months of purchase. And each time they took 1 month to repair and return the product. The courier third party assigned by boat is worst. It's no less than headache to claim warranty and deal with all this
3438,4.0,Love the bass...sound quality is good but its an (in ear earphones) so after long usage the ear hurts because of the stiffness of earplug ...other than that ...Boat has never dissapointed me in any of their products
3439,4.0,"Well it's the best wireless earphones with a good price , but with time the battery backup will decrease substantially.
Overall the there should have been a more better battery backup say for up to at least 8 hours"
3440,3.0,Its just fine... Songs will not pause n it'll not go into battery saving mode =>when earbuds are in touched with each other by magnet(if it is happening with me plz lemme know so i can exchange it) ..audio n call quality is ok.. Good for music lovers.. No connectivity issue..
3441,2.0,Unfortunately I feel money wasted as I specifically bought to talk over mobile while working but sometimes its clear & sometimes too much noise comes . Lot of trouble to ear due to that. I bought branded to avoid noise & ear problem. but disappointed.
3442,4.0,"Got it @ ₹899/-. Really feeling happy. Perfect fitting, light weight, though i haven't checked other brands but i think this is the best one for the bass lovers at this affordable price range. Surely recommend for buying"
3443,5.0,Extensively use it while riding. Amazing noise cancelling considering that i am riding with it. my headline says it all. looks neat and for my budget and purpose its more than what i could expect. Boat Rocks!!
3444,4.0,Sound quality is average. Sometimes the bass is on the higher side. Charge drops all of a sudden from 40 to 20 and then it goes off. But consider this option as it is on the budget friendly side. Rating 3.5/5.
3445,3.0,"Noise cancellation is good, and sound quality is good as well, even in calls. But, bass is poor. And battery lasts 3-4 hours max. Have to charge it daily. So if you want good quality earphone for movies and calls go for it and if you want it for bass and good battery life, don't go for it."
3446,5.0,Boat give me a better sound quality in reasonable prices always. I got new boat Bluetooth earphone and it's sound quality is so good at this price. Noice cancilation is better.
3447,1.0,"I bought this headphone 9 months back, it stopped working automatically, now I am trying to connect with boat customer support , their customer number is not working nor their support link. Unreliable product."
3448,3.0,battery life is upto 5hrs to 6 hrs and automatically disconnects and dosnot connet back until turn off power and turn on
3449,4.0,"Noice cancellation is very good.
Good Battry life. boAT having good sound quality in its every product. Prise is little bit higher side. Purchase it during amazon sell only."
3450,1.0,Product's quality is awesome but not durable at all my right side earphone stopped working in just 2 months and i just wanna say dont buy this shit product. Dont go to review of others because they wrote it in just some days use but am reviewing it after proper 2 months use.
3451,5.0,Using the headphones it is really good I like the headphones it has very strong base which is not appropriate for sound quality.
3452,4.0,It's a real good pair of earphones of Bluetooth for the price range that it sells at. Music is loud and clear. Battery backup is very decent. But I wouldn't expect a deafening base at this price range... It's good but not too of the line!!!
3453,4.0,"Treble response is poor, so high frequency sounds like that of cymbal will be muffled, bass is slightly more enhanced but is fine. Mids are quite decent.
Build quality is good and is comfortable to wear.
Battery span is not great but doable."
3454,5.0,Nice Quality
3455,3.0,Apart from the sound quality everything else is good... Sound quality should have been better...
3456,4.0,"Sound quality is excellent for the price.battery life is as stated.it will prove best buy for people on move.phone calls are flawless.sometimes I f mobile is moving ,sound flickers"
3457,5.0,"Good product. Sound effect is fantastic. But during call sometime there is a noise, but that gets okay after sometime. Overall it's a nice product."
3458,5.0,"Everything is nice about these earphones . Probably the best earphones under 2000.
Battery life is excellent"
3459,3.0,"The Bluetooth connection is pretty weak, the headphones keep getting disconnected with the slightest of movement."
3460,4.0,"In my headset one side is not working so i claimed warranty and the boat product using boat support. But , still i didn't received my headset it is nearly taking one month. So, please don't buy the product because the product and the customer support is too bad."
3461,2.0,"It's been 6-7th month form the purchase date, the earphones are stop working, I don't know what happened.
My brother is using the same product from 1-2 years his earphones are working properly.
I want to return the my earphones. As I am afraid of this."
3462,1.0,"I had purchased 2nos for this product,but one is very waste. That means it fully charged[100% battery level showing in my android phone] but leave the charger it will shutdown.So please do the needful replace it and give the details for further warranty process."
3463,1.0,"I got fake and damaged even after replacement
What is this Amazon
I normally used to buy products from u weekely
But this time u failed to give a quality and it's my last time to purchase products from u

I will never buy anything from u"
3464,1.0,"Frequent disconnection and sound cuts whenever placing phone in pocket or when phone is not ia sight of the device, only working when placing the phone very close to device, one of the worst earphones, not able to return since moved abroad right after buying it."
3465,5.0,Bass and sound quality is super . I ordered after viewing that special color .. but in real color is not that much deep .. quite disappointed.
3466,1.0,"Dont buy it i would suggest go for same bugdt different brands but not boat
Only after a month left earbud is gone and became one sided..
Moreover boat support is not even registering it.."
3467,1.0,"Within 6 months from purchase both the speakers of headphone stopped working. The provided customer service is very bad, they are not even attending the phone call, and taking much time to respond after complain lunched. Don't think product is worth of its money"
3468,1.0,It just stopped working after 2weeks. How much ever u charge it up the power never gets on. Donot get cheated on it's a worst product I have seen reveiw but didn't expect as Amazon was always loyal with product for me. But this one is worst. Total waste if money
3469,3.0,"Although music quality good....but built not good. Clips so loose I lost it after 3months. Mic was working good for first 3 months, after that it started behaving abnormally... complain of Buzzing sound from receiver end..,.not what I expected within short time."
3470,5.0,"Very good product as per price range..
Feel like premium one..
Go for this you won't regret, I assure you."
3471,3.0,Product is good . Need some improvement in earbud . Also lenght of cable need to be reduce.seem bulky
3472,1.0,"Worst product don't go for cheap price, within 6 months one side stopped working however I got replacement but guess what new headphones also got the same issue within 3 months.
Now I will go back with jbl hopefully will get some better results."
3473,3.0,"This product is okay and now would like to inform you that it can not charge, which is much within warranty period. Please let me know the procedure to get replacement/repairing.
Submitted for action please.
Thanks & Regards
S.G.KOshti"
3474,2.0,Very uncomfortable in ears! Too high bass... poor noise cancellation which results very bad call experience
3475,4.0,"Sound quality is not up to benchmark that brand given, but as i bought it in 1499/- it good product in the range also ready to rough used, build quality too much good, Baas is loud but whispered when full, 3/5 rating"
3476,4.0,I received it today itself and it works great but when I first try to connect it there is a glitch.. it is not properly connected at first but after few seconds works properly. Don't know if this a product fault or whatever. Should I place this for a replacement
3477,4.0,"Overall Sound Quality is good, Not bad. Bass is more but vocal Sound clearaty is ok ok can be enhance more. Bluetooth connectivity is also good.. Battery back up also good.

3481,5.0,Awesome product. Bass amd mixture of treble is perfect . Sweat proof and the best part is that they plug into ur ear well. Thank You boat
3482,4.0,The bass is very good in Boat Rockerz 225 and sound is also good . But the battery is okay and should improve on build quality .
3483,5.0,This is a really great feeling after getting perfect hands-free Bluetooth. It has likely 6 to 7 hr of Battery life when listening songs or having calls. Comfortable after 2 3 hrs of continuous usage. Fits in the ear nicely. 100% value for money product.
3484,5.0,Very good Bluetooth earphones with excellent sound and built quality. Battery life is also good. One thing to notice is that the wire is bit long to my liking. Totally satisfied with my purchase.
3485,3.0,"I Don't think 1490 for this product is good 👎, Weak Bluetooth connection, it's not working properly when i put it in my pocket, buttons working process is to slow..charging icon is also not working properly..but sound quality is great, battery backup is good.."
3486,2.0,"Looking like used product, packing box is fully crushed condition, Original round seal is opened both sides, and covered with external plaster. Working ok but disappointed with product condition surely used one received. requesting for replacement with new one."
3487,4.0,"Awesome bass...for only bass lovers n okok not good for tomuch talking mic is not too good, battery ok ok charging bhi thik hai, Bluetooth range kam hai okok mobile pass me hoga toh hi chalega varna giyooo bacha splash proof ka toh abhi tak aisa kuchh hua nhi"
3488,4.0,Sometimes falls from ear overall good quality but dont compare it with wired bass headphone because Bass not that great
3489,4.0,"My review after using it for 15 days , the product is worth for the money compared to other brands like JBL , Sony etc .
1) Good HD sound quality
2) awesome bass
3) battery backup is just fine gives 6hrs
playback
Overall satisfied..would like to give 4 stars"
3490,2.0,"2 Star
Noise clear it was not to good, I was not happy with this production, I am unable to listen the sound. its too low, can you replace the item, it will be good for me. please reach out to following number. 9972517557 Mahesh Kumar M"
3491,5.0,Nice product. got it for 900 which is value for money for me. very good sound quality but bass is little low for me as compare to mi bluetooth earphones. but best earphones in its price range. battery life is very good.. 1 or 2 day very easily it can live.
3492,4.0,As mentioned every thing is as it is except noise cancellation. Outside noise irritates to the listener so much. Rest is very good.
3493,5.0,"Product has received in time and in good quality , value for money.... Have see too see about battery backup"
3494,1.0,This product is 1st copy because boat rockerz earphone whenever start its sound like boat roakerz 255 but this ear phone doesn't sound like that and bluetooth name also boat rockerz not shows code n the sounds is very low not acceptable from amazon how s like uh sale 1st copy
3495,4.0,"There is no problem with the earphone, but, I have returned the item and gone in for an expensive Sony earphone."
3496,5.0,"I am totally happy to purchase this sound quality goods,product was very nice boat product always good and nice."
3497,1.0,Received parcel in good condition but when open my parcel got something like that is used one and when tried to return they played a game shown as delivered replacement and set all things up. I am using default product as its my need today. 🙁🙁🙁
3498,4.0,"Great deal under 1000
provide great bass but lack in vocal at high pitch,hey what more could you ask for 999
comfort level is at its top class
i bought this after months of reviewing dif brands and this one is the best in this budget"
3499,5.0,One of the best and most convenient earphones I have purchased so far. The sound quality is good. The only issue us the background noise while you take calls. Apart from that it's best. Recommended.
3500,4.0,"I have mi Bluetooth earphone compare to that it's really awesome bass & noise cancellation perfectly work🔥🔥🔥 value for money I buy this product 999 RS ..
Go for it guys ❤️😎"
3501,3.0,I have used both boat rockerz255 and infinity glide N100. I felt sound clarity is much better in infinity glide N100. Boat rockers has more volume levels(only good part). I don't know how people rated boat rockerz over the infinity glide.
3502,3.0,"A very average Bluetooth headset. I don't understand why so much positive reviews. I bought based on review, but it's misleading. My friend bought Boult n found the sound quality slightly better. But this one is a complete waste of money."
3503,3.0,But while driving and or walkiing the sound breaks constantly so I suggest go for a better one.
3504,5.0,"Its a very good product and im totally satisfied.
Good base and light weight.
Using it for almost a month and no issues.
Battery life good. Enough for day on a single charge.
Depends on usage.
Looks good"
3505,1.0,"The device that I had received is not good at connecting to the already paid devices... Must be a defective piece, otherwise it works fine"
3506,1.0,Bluetooth won't work for more than 3 feet. You should always keep your device next to you. Return is not available on this product
3507,2.0,"Pros
Sound quality is very good, decent bass
Connectivity is super

Cons
Build quality is very poor
Always the right side fails
Had to replace it 3 times under warranty.
Boat customer service is poor"
3508,5.0,"It gives you 5 hrs battery life if yoy use it in 70% volume...

I bought it for ₹999.

Sound quality is good bass is loud.

Bluetooth connectivity sometimes suffer.

Overall nice product."
3509,4.0,Sound quality is good but the only problem I have faced till now is noise cancellations. To much background noise is experienced by listener.
3510,4.0,"After few days of usage,I felt like boat is best for the price range they are giving.Audio qulaity & clarity is good.Bass also nice.Charge also stays for long."
3511,3.0,I have ordered 2 boat earphones(bluetooth and wire earphone). Both earphones having same problem they are not fit into ears even tried to change rubber buds as well.
3512,3.0,"After using 4 days.. I have found some cons:
*Previously I am using JBL wired headphone but after using boat found sound quality is not good.
* Battery backup less then 5 hours, not happy with that.
* Only one sided boat pot are working with low sound and voice.
Thank you."
3513,3.0,Drawback of boat rockerz is there is no next/prev song capability. But considering the price 999 during sale it's ok.
3514,4.0,"The Battery on this thing is just amazeballs ,but the only drawback is the range. This shouldn't be that big of a problem for people who always have their phones in their hand. But all in all , it's a amazing product."
3515,1.0,"Giving this review after using 5 days
Bluetooth is nice but ear buds are not so comfortable. And battery backup is 6 hour for continue using and stand using 4 days .
Worth to buy in this price ..
And there is no noise cancellation very disturbing noise when you are in calling."
3516,1.0,"It's an ok product audio is low n not clear mic is ok . It's gets disconnected after 2-3 hours and sometimes it gets mute , u can either speak or hear anything. In my opinion don't buy this product"
3517,1.0,"Its not that much good product, charging coming only for 3 hrs maximum. I am very much disappointed with charge of headphone,if your doing long journeys you cannot use this more than 3 hrs, so I will not recommend to purchase this product as per my experience."
3518,1.0,I bought this boat rockers 255f sports black headset. Within one month it got a issue with battery.. The headset is not working. Worst experience from Amazon. Didn't receive the register code after trying register for headset warranty in official boat website.
3519,1.0,Pathetic product i purchased 15 days before in sale and with in a months cracks shows on d cable and it's increasing day by day and if it goes this way i ill not be able to use this product more dn one month i recommend everyone not to buy total waste of money
3520,1.0,"Got the product just 2 days back. Bluetooth connection is very bad. Connected the earphone to my smartphone. At distance of just 1 feet, Bluetooth connection is getting lost every 2-3 minutes. I want refund/replacement."
3521,4.0,Total value for money. Noise cancellation ok ok types but sound clarity is awesome. Takes a bit time to connect to phone but rest is perfectly ok.
3522,3.0,"I ordered in republic day sale.
The seal was broken....when I opened it
And the product I recieved was wireless and magnetic also but I recieved a defective product as I think.
I applied for the refund...now...
I wish Amazon give it back soon"
3523,3.0,"Battery discard very fast. 3 hrs on full charge.
When you riding bike collar band fly away.
Thought it's is wireless headphones but the wire from the collar band to ear buds are too big."
3524,1.0,I have purchased it on 4 th of june and it's not even a month old and it's not charging it was even having some issues the volume of it was also not working
3525,3.0,It's good for exceptional listening experience ..only drawback is it's ear buds does not stick..keep coming out while doing heavy work out...
3526,4.0,"Sound is lower than others & boat branded bass is missing, no vibrate alert yet it's ruling for this price & quality😍"
3527,4.0,"The product is really awesome very good sound and battery life
The bad thing is it does not connect with two devices that well
And if u move out of range of u r laptop it does not connect when you come back in range
Overall very good"
3528,1.0,Pathetic product... Already exchanged once because it had started giving connectivity problem in a week and now again the new product is giving the same problem also when it is connected no sound is coming... I recommend not buying it...total waste
3529,2.0,The name is 100% justified. These are meant to be used only playing sport. Ergonomics are good but sound quality is not balanced. Too much bass. EDM listeners will love these earphones but aren't meant for classical.
3530,4.0,"Got it for an irresistible price of ₹899. An excellent product for this price. Decent sound quality and amazingly loud. After sales service of boat is also trustworthy. So if your budget is around 1k, just go for it."
3531,1.0,"My device charging jack got damaged in 2 months time...Approached Ghaziabad, RDC BOAT Service center they are simply doing formality..."
3532,5.0,"Excellent product in this price range I'm buying this in offer zone I got in just-999
Sound quality is just awesome.
Base already excellent.
Battery life thumbs up👍

3539,5.0,Crystal clear sound and Bluetooth connectivity is very good. Satisfied with purchase.
3540,1.0,Boat is fraud company. Some headphone works perfectly but there many defective products. If you claim for warranty they will get the product and they won't return it. There are lot of complaints like this in Facebook and Twitter. Don't buy anything from boat.
3541,5.0,Its being 4-5 months I bought this product and its really amazing the sound quality is good and noise cancellation is doing a great job. the battery stays nearly about a day if you use continuously or it will remain about 2-3 days if 2-3 hrs per day of usage.
3542,2.0,99% earphones right side not working ofter two months . its tru not fake reviews frnds...
3543,2.0,"I got a damaged product on my first delivery then on exchange within 2-3 weeks i am having connectivity issue, also the voice quality is not as such, I'm not impressed by the product and it's not buying worth it, and if there would be a return option i would have gone for it"
3544,4.0,This product surely does have good bass and it fits well. The main con would be that the wire extending from the neck band is unnecessarily long and the size cannot be reduced.
3545,1.0,"I have used this headphone just a week and right side earphone is not working at all
Really very disappointed with this"
3546,1.0,"Don't buy boat company product...
1. After 2 months this boat bluetooth stops working...
2. Charging port pin does not working in so times...
3. Automatically call cancellation
4. Worst nd very cheap quality product"
3547,5.0,I got this one for 900. It's dojbg the more than what I expected from an earphone under 1000. Quality of sound is good loud enough and consistent. No connection deop. Best part of this earphones is it can connect to 2 devices at a time.
3548,2.0,"Product was working well, but after 6months of use one side has stopped working and the product is covered in warranty but the customer care number is invalid and there are no updates on my warranty. Very poor service from the company on warranty."

3556,5.0,"Bluetooth connectivity - upto 10 meters
Noise cancellation - Okay
Sound quality - very good."
3557,2.0,First time dissapointed with Boat product. It the noise cancellation doesnt work at all the person at the other end of the call keeps complaining of background noise. The sound quality isnt good. Lastly the make os not great so it keeps falling off the ears.
3558,1.0,A review after an year of usage in which 4 months the product was with the company itself bcz it wasnt charging disconnected the calls automatically and didn't get any battery for more tha. 3 4 hours. Even registered many complaints none got through properly
3559,1.0,"Bad Product. Bluetooth gets disconnected every few minutes. Doesn't get pair easily.

Painful to ear if used for hours. Not worth buying. Better Bluetooth earphones are available.

I want to return it. Please take this back and refund me."
3560,5.0,"First Words :""FAB"". It's a Best buy to feel music .Water resistance is far more than better .Bass will butter ur heads literally .Just ignore the fir of the ear supporters there cuz they fall off at times when we r too harsh in fitting them into our ears 😂."
3561,5.0,The earphones are very good . The sound quality is good . Its connectivity is great. I can recommend it to everyone. ;) as it costed me 900rs in the sale. Thanks amazon for this.
3562,1.0,Was working good till 15 days and suddenly stopped charging...misplaced it's receipts and packing so I can't return it back now..any sort of help from service provider will be appreciated
3563,3.0,"This review i am writing after using for 3months.
1.If i am away about 4feets also bluetooth is not clear.
2.It's good sound
3.charnging if it reach 80% it's Directly get down to zero.I am not happy with this"
3564,4.0,"All superb but we can’t adjust the wire, it’s is lengthy. Product is so good and I watch a movie “John wick ”it’s gives theater experience."
3565,5.0,"Better than realme wireless buds.
Bought both gifted the realme ones .
Boat is way better"
3566,5.0,"Best product ever , nice sound , bass , and most important thing is a battery life run up to 10 hours to listen countinously music"
3567,3.0," Got damaged after five months
Left speaker got damage"
3568,2.0,The wire is a little long.. and sound clarity is not good. Charging pin is too delicate.
3569,3.0,"Product is overall good, great sound quality, good noise cancellation, good bass, playtime is also good, but facing an issue with the battery percentage-> after becoming 60%, its start showing low battery within 5-10mins on further use"
3570,3.0,Good product in these range. Noise cancellation is working good while riding bike. Sound quality is also good bt please don't campare it from JBL earphones. Even JBL earphones are also not giving noice cancellation in this price range.
3571,3.0,This products sound quality is awesome. I bought this product on 13 march 2019 but today suddenly the right earpiece is not working.... As this product is under warranty so i wanted to replace it but I'm not being provided by any replace option in Amazon..
3572,3.0,"Simple review

All those who are giving this 4-5 stars haven't really listened to quality earphones / headphones, I guess.
The bass is fake.. Pure fake.. If your budget is low, it will just give you a mediocre experience. Thats it."
3573,3.0,"Sound quality, bass, connectivity everything is fine with this product except the mic. It's capturing lots of background noises, even the noises which i hardly hear in my background. Its very unpleasant while speaking to anybody through this mic."
3574,1.0,Very high bass. Not comfortable for ears after 10 min. Sound is also not that much clear than expected from boat earphones. Always check about the item that is it returnable or not. My suggestion not to buy it. Will create headache in 10 minutes.
3575,1.0,After using 4 months it's not working. Total stopped working no service center s in Hyderabad only 1 service center in Hyderabad in its working only. 4 months after 4. months not working
3576,4.0,"Durability is really good, flexible and doesn't fall off ears that easy, although the rubber material used for the eargrip isn't that great and is the only con (for which I have given a star less). Also for the price it's available, one can't really complain about battery. Which is 6hrs."
3577,1.0,"Good sound quality but equally uncomfortable, one will have to struggle to fit it, in the ear .

It sipped charging and working in 10 days."
3578,5.0,sound quality is apt with all the right blend of bass n tremble sound is equally clear. battery life is easily 6hr plus in terms continuous and relentless uses of media n can go upto 7 hr or more when listening only to music. product quality is also gud.
3579,1.0,"I bought this in 1st Oct 19, it was working good till 7th Jan 2020. That means around three monts , now mic is not working but speaker is till normal."
3580,1.0,"Product is good but service not. I ll tell you why, my product became one sided after using it for 6 months and as per procedure i have raised the ticket but its been 20 days and no response from company end. Pathetic service."
3581,4.0,"Showing wrong battery percentage.. From 80% , it directly jumps to 20% without attaining any intermediate number..not really satisfied.. Also the battery should have been more powerful.. An average product with high price.."
3582,5.0,"The sound quality is good, but a little more bass could add the fun. Otherwise its a good product with good battery backup, easy to carry and the agnetic earpieces is really helpful. Bought it for 1200 and I don't regret it."
3583,3.0,Led stopped working just after 4 months. Rest is working fine. Sound quality is excellent.
3584,3.0,"Battery is okay but seems did not last longer.
I have SkullCaandy Ink'd wireless before. It has got 8hrs & this has 6hrs. May be because of this

Other than that it's perfect to go"
3585,3.0,"The headphones are good quality but after six months of use the left earpod has stopped working. With Boat we expect quality and reliability, but very sorry to say it has not lived up to the mark"
3586,2.0,Product not worth.. Sound quality is good but there are some Bluetooth connectivity issue occuranc happen every Time
3587,1.0,The product is unworthy and useless it's not been 3months one of the speaker is not working how to claim the warranty
3588,4.0,So far so good ..used for 7 days..don't want to give five star since I have only used a week. Otherwise no issues with it. Got it 899 so happy with it
3589,5.0,"Value for money..best headset for this price range...

Good Sound Quality - 9/10
Awesome Base - 10/10
Decent Battery Life 0- 7/10
Build and Design - 8/10
Worth the Price - 9/10
Overall - 9/10"
3590,1.0,"Voice quility is poor over call.
Opposit party complints abouts lost of distrabance .
and it cause stress in ears."
3591,1.0,"This is worst product. I never suggest to buy it. Even if this product is disorder and you will complaint in support-boat-lifestyle.com, they will not respond on time. It's takes 2 months for exchanging this product. Very disappointing to brought this ."
3592,3.0,It worked only 5 months then it's waste of money. Guys please dont look at brand . The thing is instead of buying at 1.4 k which works only 5 to 6 months. We can go with 200 rupees local one where we can buys 7 earphone which will work for one year.........
3593,5.0,"Worth for money product.. earphones, sound quality everything is amazing. The only flaw could be earplugs are little bigger than usually. Even the normal size doesn't fit into my ear. I'm using the earphones with smaller earbuds given in the pack."
3594,5.0,"I used this since 3 months ago.
Sound quality is perfect. Good combination of Bass and treble. Can feel every beat.
Connectivity is quick. Detects and connects easily.
Battery life is good. In a 10 min charge u can use for 1 hour continuesly"
3595,3.0,What I don't like about the product is that the earphones are heavy in terms of weight. Now Amazon says I can't return it to buy better earphones. It can only be replaced with a same product which is of no use. Just be aware of this policy before you buy it
3596,3.0,Battery get finished very soon. it will be better if a more powerful has been provided so that without charging again we can use it for at least 12 hrs. Then it will be easy to use it during long journey.
3597,3.0,Sound quality is ok... don't except any thing exception. Battery last for 3 to 4 of days...with medium use of 2 hrs. everyday. Unable to understand showing 60% on mobile and battery drain out within 15 mins... don't know how?
3598,4.0,"Best option for music listeners in this price range. Sound quality and battery backup is good. But has issues with call connectivity, voice breakage."
3599,1.0,"After using it for 2 months the Right Side stoped working I tried to claim warranty online but everyday it said ""oops something went wrong"" maybe because there is no service centre in Pune, Maharashtra. Please check if there is a Boat service centre in your City and buy this peace of *crap*"
3600,5.0,"Sonud quality is really excellent...
In this price, this is the best product...
Go for it without any doubt..
I m totally satisfied from this item.."

Thanks to Amazon for 🙏connect to #boat.....

Ek line bolu ga mai...
Pahle istamal karo, fir wiswas karo.... 👌

First use it, then believe.💥"
3602,2.0,"The right side has stopped working, it has been just 2 months that i have purchased. I am not satisfied with the product. It isn't even a scenario as if i used every day. I want exchange."
3603,2.0,Worst earphones ever. The funny part is whenever you try to listen a music of good quality with awesome bass the intention of these heaadpones is the make that music unbearable. I wish the brand would have endorsed in technology and quality rather then marketing and actors endorsement.
3604,1.0,"Poor vocal and mid range balancing. Unable to hear lyrics. Only bass is high in all songs/ music. Getting irritated because of high bass on a good melody soft song. Though call quality is good, because of too high bass, I disliked it."
3605,2.0,"All it's featires are good. But it does not last long. Ordered in july and in just 3 months, they're damaged."
3606,5.0,I'm really proud to say that it crossing 6th month of purchases really gud product and 24 hours standby 8 hours of random usage 5hours of continues usage unbelievable product from bOAt if its finished again I going to buy it again because best in price...
3607,5.0,The product is all in one like headphones with mic the rubber is very soft as expected and regarding sound the bass is perfect. And Amazon service is class apart
3608,1.0,First one week the produt was working good but after that there is battery issue when even there is 40% battery it tells us tht battery low nd it will off directly waist product i received and after one month the product stopped working waste of money dont buy guyssss
3609,3.0,"The product is good but some times sound cuts while traveling, so the quality of the sound got affected, battery life is good, those who wants to buy for music should look for another product."
3610,2.0,Very poor quality. sound is not a crystal clear sound.Bass sound is very poor
3611,3.0,The Product is well packed and delivered on time... The Main Problem with the boAt Rockerz 255 is it disconnects it's bluetooth connectivity after a distance of 2m from the phone. Then Brand Mark boAt written on both ear is starting to disapper.
3612,1.0,"Such a crap product, only one side of the earphone is working now and it is only a month since I bought this product, now I am unable to contact for replacement also..Because the number given here is invalid... For warranty"
3613,4.0,"Sound quality is good.
Noise cancellation is nice
Wire lenght should have bee cut a bit. But its a manfucturers design"
3614,1.0,It's not at all worth the money and the main reason is its wireless connectivity. Sounds keeps on distorting when you are in motion and your phone is in your pocket or at some distance and that's the main reason for using wireless headphones which this does not fulfils
3615,4.0,"Earphone worked fine for 5 months and then stopped working.
Claimed replacement under warranty a month back and still waiting for revert from Boat.
Service from Boat is worst. No response for mails and customer support.
Buy at your own risk."
3616,1.0,"This is really not professional, I had register complaints twice for my Bluetooth headset and I am really disappointed to say that both the time I received damaged/not working headset each time.
Probably, the worst customer service I ever experienced."
3617,3.0,"Material quality is not that good what u expect from a brand boat
Sound is ok but its giving out unnecessary bass ( i was using a wired jbl headset which is way better in terms of sound quality)
Not at all ideal for gaming
Call quality is ok"
3618,4.0,"Sound quality, Connectivity is overall good
Battery backup is also good
Only thing is neckband is very hard
Sound quality can be improved.
Price should be in range of 800-850"
3619,3.0,"I replaced this
Try to give genuine product
Actually i loved a lot
But full charge to 50% it gives 4 hours of talktime and music playback
After getting 50% it suddenly getting down
Shows battery dead"
3620,5.0,Obviously it is the best headphone under 1000 but with more discount i got it under 944 rs but connectivity sometimes take more time but everything is good 😌😌😌 the sound quality is awesome 😌😌
3621,5.0,Such A great ... Volume Quality Is Best....I like For The 8/9 hours battery backup.....such a great value for money.....I have Also Use Daily Any Time For Last 4 Months....No Any Problem 😍😍😍😎👍👍👍👍

3623,1.0,"I ordered this headphone. It's not worth for even 300 also. When I try to watch movie or hear songs. I can't able to hear the voice or sounds, I am hearing only air noise. Please don't buy this headphone."
3624,5.0,"It is a beautiful product, we like the design and the sound quality is superb you feel the hi-fi even at lower volume, nice feeling
We are really satisfied with the product"
3625,4.0,"Excellent stereo output, Loud, clear sound
A little too extra on the bass side, messing the vocals, might want to tune the Equalizer a bit"
3626,5.0,"Updated review:
One ear in the headphone stopped working. I requested for a warranty and it was replaced with a new one within a week's time. Great customer service. Thanks Boat

Nice audio quality and the battery lasts for one full day"
3627,1.0,"The left side stopped working The sound quality is very bad. Not at all satisfied with this product. Not worth your money. There's always some disturbance in the mic, so the other person can't hear your voice. Also the accesories attached keeps coming off. Very disappointed."
3628,5.0,"Amazing sound quality, specially the crispiness and bass. Worth for the money."
3629,5.0,"Runs for longer time, once charged. Good quality sound. Good quality material. Light weight. No negatives noticed since 8 months"
3630,1.0,Very bad experience..i had heard good things about boat earphones..about soubd quality and durability..but my new earphones wont even start..i have not used it even for a day..it turns on only when its on charge..otherwise it wont even start after charging for a whole day..i want my money
3631,4.0,It’s good but could have been better at this price. Overall I am satisfied. But mic is not good. Your caller won’t hear your voice. It’s good for listening music.battery back up is good

3637,1.0,Worst ever sound quality. The bass is too high and that too is not the good bass. The treble is not even audible as compared to the bass. Noise cancellation is good. If you are buying this for music I would suggest you to go for some other device. This is good just for calls.
3638,2.0,"Poor Battery backup. Switched off when battery backup is 20%.
Not really Worthy to buy it.
This should be in 300 to 500 rang product"
3639,4.0,"Overall its average Bluetooth headset.
The main problem of this headset is its range.I can't cross barely from one room to another which count a distance approximately 5 meter after connecting it from phone."
3640,3.0,"Sound is good but battery backup worst, when drops to 40%, it constantly says, ^oops battery low ^ and within 10 minutes battery drops to 20% and it gets off next minute. And in virar local train rush it gets connected disconnected frequently 😂😂"

3730,1.0,"First of all seller is selling service product in the name of original one. Service product is the product which is delivered by Boat India, if your bluetooth headset gets damaged in warranty.
So better go for boat rokerz 255F or 255R."

I packed boat and stored aside , since return period is over.

Beware of your ears before buying boat rockerz"
3798,1.0,Don't buy this product. It creates disturbances to 2nd person in call and you won't be knowing what's happening. Person on the other side of your cl will not be hear a word even if you were talking in silent room. Im now using it only to hear music.

3804,5.0,"Best hai I having Mi sports too and even i try Tagg Bluetooth too but this one i found best among these range.
Base sound dono best hai.

3822,1.0,"Battery backup is very low, very disappointed, i bought it by seeing company review charge last for 2vdays and more, but it only last 2 hrs of continuous use for me, better don't buybit if you are looking for more charge lasting product."
3823,3.0,"Good earphones for those who loves bass! But the drawback is that it doesn't have clear clarity of treble. It has less clarity and more bass! And so according to this feature the cost 1,699/- is bit more. But you get a good battery backup and good built quality."

3828,5.0,"I got it around 1k so at that price best from BOAT.
Noise cancellation is not at it best.
I am using it daily for office calls"

3833,5.0,This is a good and best product you can buy if your budget is below 1500 the sound quality is best and the over all material quality is very good this can be the best choice under 1500 in this amount this is the good deal to have .......
3834,4.0,Overall good but left bud is not sticking in ear.Falling down even when sitting.
3835,3.0,Good Sound Quality comfortable for listening songs not good for Calls as there is noise cancellation and it's very disturbing noise other person can't hear what we are talking. Good for Music only

Also connecting with pc not possible"
3843,5.0,The earphones are very much good for every day use. Because the battery backup is excellent and very much handy& flexible to use. I really loved the earphones very much. And the sound quality and the deep bass you get is the best.
3844,5.0,The earphones fits perfect to ears. Sound is good and control buttons are also great.. Battery back up is so long.. You can watch movies or listen to music all day long by just charging for 20-25 minutes.

3940,1.0,It provides very good quality sound and battery backup of 6 to 7 hrs but Don't buy it because after use of 2 months the right side of the earphone stoped working and after a week the left side has also gone.This same thing happend with my friends also.

3942,3.0,Headset is worth a price but still it's built is not quite comfortable. Earpiece buds of all size is uncomfortable and it is uncalled to use for long duration. The length of the attachment makes to look us funny sometimes.

3961,3.0,Product quality is very poor. You don't know when it will die. Device will show Power level at >30% but suddenly it will drop to zero and die. Even though they gave 3 types of ear caps it won't fit. Overall it's not worth for money.
3962,5.0,Good product and having sound quality is superb and bass is bass....If you want wireless headphones then go for it .I got in Rs.999.

3999,1.0,Never ever buy boat product. It's not to claim warranty on your product. My earphone stopped working within 6 months of purchase. I tried calling costumer care but I couldn't talk to anybody. Their service center numbers are also not working.
4000,4.0,"If you looking for a Bluetooth headphone of Best Quality Sound (Bass) in lowest price just invest in it. I am too using this headphone and it is the best.
If you are sick of wired headphone getting damaged after 6-7 months grab this one."

4009,4.0,Good in the class below 1k. Noise cancellation could be better for this category. Overall a good purchase for music lovers & regular usage.
4010,1.0,"It's not value for money I'll not prefer this product. We can hear out side noise even in full voice 👎 not impressed. Its looks wired it has very long wire,..... Dont bye it. 0 for noise cancellation"
4011,5.0,Best quality Bluetooth headsets from Boat. It provides amazing noise cancellation and good sound quality with extra bass. I purchased it at 799 during festival sales. Best to purchase at such price...
4012,2.0,In open place ever one voice is captured other than mine. Opposite person can't hear my voice. Noice cancellation is not working in this module. I wasted money and purchased 3set and gifted 3 friends.
4013,1.0,Least value for money. One of the earphone started non functioning in just 3 months. Neither manufacturer nor supplier takes responsibility of replacement and blames the end product user for the same.
4014,4.0,"Overall good product, sound quality is awesome, the design can be improved , the wire hanging from ears around the neck looks little clumsy and also the ear piece tend to fall sometimes because if the weight of the wire."
4015,4.0,"Writing review after using for 1 month
Awesome BT earphone at this price... Battery back up is around 5 to 6 hours.. But once the battery% comes to 20 % it hardly stays for 5 mins..... That's the only cons....
Over all 8/10...."

4017,4.0,"Wish the manufacturer had put in a battery that would last longer, rest is OK"
4018,1.0,"Not a very good product... I have used it for quite sometime. Bluetooth disconnects pretty often...

The mic picks up surrounding sound rather than the person speaking in the mic.."
4019,5.0,Purchased it on Great Indian Sale at 899 Rs. Product is really good.I used Sennheiser cx-180 and I can say that even if you buy Boat Rockerz 255 at 1499 Rs it is still worth in terms of sound quality.
4020,1.0,The Bluetooth got burnt while charging for 1 hour.its been only 15 days since I purchased this boat rockers earphone. I need a replacement.

4029,4.0,"Strong bass and overall good soung quality, I would say much better than some Skullcandy and JBL models. Justifies its price aptly.
Although it gives a playback time of good 6-7 hrs, I feel it could just have been a little better had it been around >10 hrs."
4030,2.0,Product description tells the battery life to be 6 hours... But it won't last for more than 3 hours
4031,2.0,The product's Cha rging point got damaged in 3 month. Not at all expected
4032,2.0,Boat has lot of disturbance while talking on a call and also noise cancellation does not work at all..Ant audio is far better than this. No distrubance at all and also noise cancellation is excellent...Used on bike and during workouts as well

Ear. Poor battery back up. Not worth for the value"

4038,3.0,"For the cost you can go for better bluetooth, it's just waste got it 6 months back already one side it's gone. And their customer support is the worst. And bluetooth connectivity is poor under extreme crowd and easily interrupted."
4039,4.0,"I think the best sound, I have JBL too but these are way better.
Going to order the 3rd one now. Gifted the other two.

4055,5.0,"Quality is awesome, the fact that I got it for the cheaper price"
4056,4.0,"Very good product at this price. Battery lasts for about 5 hours. The only issue is that it doesn't show you the remaining battery, from 100% it goes to 80, and then ""Battery Low"", nothing in between."
4057,4.0,Betterty life indicator us not accurate. When it reaches 60% within half and hour you get a bettery low notification. Rest all are perfect at the price.

4065,3.0,"It a amazing Bluetooth head, boat has really taken over the market. Good sound quality n bass effect is also nice. Only disadvantage is you can't change the songs or video from headphone itself, it doesn't have forward or backward button in it. Else it a go for it headset."

4248,5.0,"Sounds quality best
Value for money..."
4249,3.0,Bluetooth coverage is not good and sound quality like noise cancellation and clarity is also not proper compare to other same price range products. Fitting is good and battery backup.

4257,1.0,Went for it looking at the reviews. But it's just another product. Don't expect anything out of the ordinary. Build quality is very pathetic for someone who's a rough user. Would not recommend if you are looking for a quality product.
4258,1.0,Uncomfortable to wear to the extent that one cannot wear them for more than an hour. The earbuds are so heavy that the ear starts to ache. Does not support discord call while gaming...huge disappointment. Mike isn't that great either.
4259,2.0,Well it didn’t run for more than a Month and was an extremely disappointing experience of my first piece bought being so short lived. I don’t think I can go back and buy anything from boat now.
4260,1.0,After months ear phone stopped working properly. Charging light doesn't work properly. This was my first wireless earphone and my suggestion is it is better to go for wired one. Those are far reliable & of greater quality.
4261,4.0,Sometimes there are connectivity problems and if you don't keep it properly then earphone's sound quality is degraded or sometimes we are unable to hear the voice... If you maintain it properly then it is very good choice..

4437,4.0,Got the earphones for ₹999 during sale. Worth the price. The sound quality is comparable to the boats 220 wired earphones. Comfortable to wear and light weight. Battery life is okayish. Needs quite some time to charge.

Well it has not given any complaint as such , but there is a snag in the Bluetooth connection makes weird noises ."
4445,4.0,"Comfortable in ears, good bass, Nice volume controls. Overall good"

4454,4.0,Voice call clarity is good but music volume is very low.

4456,4.0,"It has excellent bass and does quite bit of noise cancelling. The sound quality is good but is a little muffled especially for the vocals ( i.e the dialogues, lyrics, etc). But it is okay for the price (899/-) in which I got it."
4457,1.0,"My headphone was delivered on 17th july 2019,

4465,5.0,"Good product by Boat, i m using it daily, very light weight, battery backup is average but not poor, if you love to listen Bass boost songs than definitely its for you. Satisfied with this product at the price of 999 /-."
4466,4.0,"Overall earphones are nice with good battery backup even more than 6 hr.
But there is a disturbance in the background all the time which irritates me alot even during watching a movie you will hear a disturbance."

4593,3.0,If ur wearing out of ur T-shirt or Shirt surrounding noise comes too much to other person than ur voice if ur on call.. Nw right ear is not working only one side is working... How to claim the warranty
4594,5.0,Value for money. This is my second purchase for my wife.
4595,3.0,There's no noise cancellation feature. So when on calls the outside noises dominate our voice causing alot of disturbance for the other person taking the call. This is main reason this particular headset FAILS. Otherwise rest all features are great.

4600,5.0,Bass is really good but treble is very low as compare to Bass. It should be balanced with Bass as well.

4613,3.0,"Bluetooth connectivity isn't good and its upto 6-7 m only. Bluetooth will start disconnecting when there is any obstacles mobile and rockerz.
Battery directly discharges from 80 to 0. Wrong battery indicator."

4976,5.0,Works perfectly fine and sound quality is good and clear. Battery back is upto the mark works 7-8 hrs on single charge. Also perfectly connects with android and ios devices at same time and works flawlessly.
4977,1.0,"Sound transmission is poor, connectivity range is not 10m range, & Amazon days are over in India because while you go to return they call you to dispatch the product by self,what the rubbish hell is this."
4978,3.0,"Sound is good but service is not trustable

4980,1.0,"Sound quality and other features are good. But the headphone stops working within the warranty period. When sent for warranty claim, the customer care never responds your call or email. Worst experience."
4981,1.0,The product met below expectation on noise cancellation. This feature I feel needs to be removed from product specifications since it is misleading. A hands free with out this feature does help in anyway.
4982,1.0,"Please don't buy this product, this review by my own experience, I suggested to Amazon please maintain only quality products not like this cheap products, worst Bluetooth headphones boat rockerz"
4983,3.0,Good. But after couple of months audio level dropped and now im unable to use it
4984,4.0,"Not as expected but fine,if you looking for Cristal clear sound go for JBL"
4985,5.0,I havegot it just today. I am completely satisfied with the sound quality. It has perfect bass.but i am little bit suspicious on its built quality .let's see for few months more
4986,1.0,The Headphones stopped working in 2months also background noise cancelling is worst since it picks background noise more than the actual voice
4987,4.0,"Experience good. Compare to remaining bluetooth from boat . best buy for rs999
Perfect fit"
4988,2.0,"No doubt this product was working excellent for starting one month.
Now suddenly there is some noise disturbance and sound is low.

Sometimes sound is breaking."
4989,4.0,Do not suited cable and long cable or bad cable...not bueaty earplug
4990,1.0,Disappointed as it was not working and no one asked for replacement for it from amazon. Not done you should have provided a replacement after checking the defective one that I returned
4991,3.0,"A good product, my only disappointment was that it doesn't stop playing music when the ear buds are attached together.
The product box is not good, it is difficult to keep it back in product box."
4992,4.0,Bass could have been improved. Otherwise a good buy. Pleased.
4993,4.0,"Good for starters
You'll feel the bass but they can't match the sound quality of either my boat rockers 600 or Sony xb55AP but still got it for 750 good for that"
4994,1.0,My earphone stopped working few days back then I created ticket on boat service center boat is saying that invoice is not valid hence we can't replace your earphones.
4995,4.0,"Overall its good product
But Bluetooth connectivity can be improved after 6m it does not perform well.
Like example if you are sitting in room and your phone is in other room then it does not perfom well."
4996,1.0,"There is some problem in my boat headset i need replacement because it doesn't work well kindly do the needful . Where should i go for replacement pl send the details , I have all accessories and warrenty card also"
4997,1.0,I have bought these boat rockerz 255 in February and now one of the earbud(right) is not working from a month also it have an warrenty of 1 year. But I'm not able to understand where and how to claim this warrenty.
4998,2.0,"This Bluetooth ear phone quality is good.
But I'm facing some issue with connectivity and data losses during call., etc.
I have mention this problem in warranty claim. Still that same problem is going on."
4999,1.0,Unreliable product. Earphones stopped working after 3 months n it took a moth for replacement. The replaced product also stopped working after couple of months. Worst product from boat. I suggest not to go for this
5000,4.0,"Good sound, only improvement point is wire length sould be little small"
5001,5.0,The sound quality is really good and noise cancelling too. My younger brother Manu said not to buy it but even then i brought it and i am not regretting even 1%.
